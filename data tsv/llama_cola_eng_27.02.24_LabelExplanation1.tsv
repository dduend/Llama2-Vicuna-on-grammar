0	"The subject of the verb ""kicked"" is not clear. It should be either ""They kicked him/her/them,"" or ""He/She/They kicked them."" to make it grammatically correct."
0	"The first mistake is that the verb ""ate"" should be in the present tense instead of past tense since it describes an action happening now. So, it should be ""The monkey eats the banana."""
0	"The verb tense inconsistency is the error I found. You used ""would like"" which implies a future desire, but then you wrote ""swim 1,"" which suggests that it's already happening or will happen soon. To fix this, you could change either ""like"" to ""want"" or replace ""swim 1"" with the correct form of the verb in the present tense (e.g., ""I would like to swim"")."
0	"The verb ""kicked"" should be in the third person singular form ""kick"" to agree with the subject ""I"". Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: I kicked myself."
