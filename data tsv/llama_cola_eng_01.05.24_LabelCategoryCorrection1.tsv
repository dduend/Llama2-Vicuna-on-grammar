0	syntax	" The correct version of the sentence should be ""How fierce was the battle?""
    4. Here's why: In English, we use past tense to describe completed actions or states, and ""how"" is typically used as an adverb to modify verbs. In your original sentence, ""fierce"" is a noun, not a verb, so it doesn't make sense to ask how fierce the battle was in the present tense. By changing ""is"" to ""was,"" we can fix the syntax and make the sentence grammatically correct.

    4. Here's why: In your original sentence, ""inquired"" is not the best choice of verb because it implies a formal or official inquiry, which may not be what you meant. Additionally, ""when could we leave"" is a bit awkward and unclear - it would be better to use the more straightforward phrase ""when can we leave."" So, I suggested ""I asked when we could leave,"" which is clearer and more natural-sounding.
