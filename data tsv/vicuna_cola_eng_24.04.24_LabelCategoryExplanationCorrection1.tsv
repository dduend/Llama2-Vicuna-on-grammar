"
1	none	" None.
"	" The sentence is already grammatically correct.



"
0	syntax	" The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is structured as a conditional sentence but it is not a complete sentence. The subject of the sentence ""you"" is missing a verb after ""eaten more"".
"	" The correct version of the sentence would be: ""If you had eaten more, you would want less.""



"
0	syntax	" The mistake is that the sentence is grammatically incomplete and difficult to understand. It is missing a subject and a verb in the second clause, and the word ""want"" should be in the base form ""want"" as it is the second verb in the sentence.
"	" The correct version of the sentence would be: ""As you eat the most, you want the least.""



"
0	syntax	" The mistake is a grammatical structure issue where the verb ""want"" is incorrectly placed before the verb ""eat"" in the sentence. The correct order should be ""The more you eat, the less you would want.""
"	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""The more you eat, the less you would want.""



"

"	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""The more John eats, the more he pays.""
In the original sentence, ""demand"" is not the right verb to use in this context. Instead, ""The more John eats"" should be in the present tense and ""the more he pays"" should be a result of eating more. The correct version of the sentence is grammatically correct and conveys the intended meaning clearly.



"

"
0	syntax	" The mistake is that the sentence is grammatically incomplete and confusing. The subject of the sentence (his expectations) is not clearly connected to the verb (are). Additionally, the phrase ""the lower his expectations are"" is not grammatically correct.
"	" The correct version of the sentence could be: ""The higher the stakes, the lower his expectations."" This version removes the confusing and incomplete phrase and makes the subject and verb clear.



"
0	syntax	" The mistake is in the word order. The correct word order for a compound sentence with ""the more"" and ""the less"" is ""the more x, the less y"". In your sentence, it should be ""The more obnoxious Fred is, the less attention you should pay to him.""

"
0	syntax	" The mistake is that the sentence is confusing and could be rephrased for clarity. The subject of the sentence is ""most people"" but the verb ""consider"" is in the present tense which suggests that they are currently considering Klaus guilty of murder. However, the second clause of the sentence states that the courts did not find Klaus guilty. This creates a contradiction and confusion in the meaning of the sentence.
"	" A possible corrected version of the sentence could be: ""Most people probably consider Klaus guilty of murder, even though the courts did not actually find him guilty."" The verb ""consider"" is in the simple past tense to indicate a past action and the meaning of the sentence is clear and coherent.

"
0	syntax	" The sentence is almost perfect, but there is an issue with the placement of the phrase ""regarded as being absurd."" It should be placed after the subject ""the mayor"" for proper syntax.
"	" The correct version of the sentence would be: ""The mayor regarded the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith as absurd.""



"
0	syntax	" The subject of the sentence ""I"" is in the first person singular, but the verb ""left"" is in the past tense, which suggests that the action has already been completed. The sentence implies that the speaker wants Bill to leave, but the past tense suggests that Bill has already left. The sentence is grammatically correct, but it may be unclear in terms of meaning.
"	" The correct version of the sentence would be: ""I want Bill to leave to remain a secret."" This version uses the present tense of the verb ""leave"" to indicate that the action has not yet occurred, and it is clear that the speaker wants Bill to leave in the future in order to keep it a secret.

"
0	syntax	" The mistake is in the word order. The subject of the sentence, ""Mike,"" should be in front of the verb ""quipped."" Additionally, the phrase ""never wore this hat"" should be in past tense to match the past tense verb ""quipped.""

"	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""Maxwell is a doctor.""



"
0	syntax	" The mistake is that you have used two commas in one sentence, which is not grammatically correct. The correct way to use commas in this sentence would be to separate the two clauses with a semicolon or a period.

"
0	syntax	" The sentence has a few grammar mistakes. The main issue is that the verb ""to be"" is not necessary in the sentence, and it is unclear what it is referring to. Additionally, the phrase ""for you to put on"" is redundant, as ""ready for"" already implies that the socks are intended to be put on.

"
1	none	" None
"	" The sentence is already grammatically correct.



"
0	syntax	" The subject of the sentence ""This violin"" is ambiguous. It could refer to either the physical violin or the person holding the violin. The sentence as written suggests that the violin itself is having difficulty playing the sonatas, which is not grammatically correct.
"	" ""Playing"" should be in the present tense to describe the action of playing sonatas. Additionally, it's more natural to say ""difficult to play sonatas on this violin"" to clarify that the person is having difficulty playing the sonatas on the violin.

Corrected sentence: ""This violin is difficult to play sonatas on.""
