0	" The subject ""I"" and verb ""demand"" don't agree in number (singular vs. plural). Also, there should be a comma after ""John.""

"
0	" The first issue is that you have a comma splice instead of using proper punctuation to separate two independent clauses. The second issue is the use of ""either"" at the end of the sentence, which could be rephrased for clarity or omitted if it doesn't add necessary meaning. "	" Here's a corrected version with appropriate punctuation and revised phrasing: ""I can't believe Fred won't."" (Note: If you want to include the idea that you are surprised by both options, you could say ""I can't believe Fred won't do either."")

"
0	" The first issue is that you have a comma splice instead of using proper punctuation to separate the independent clauses.

"
0	" The first issue is that you have a comma splice instead of using proper punctuation to separate the independent clauses.

"
0	" The first issue is that you have a comma splice instead of using proper punctuation to separate the independent clauses. The second issue is the use of ""did it"" which could be rephrased for clarity or replaced with an appropriate verb form if it doesn't add necessary meaning. Additionally, there seems to be some confusion in the sentence as it implies that Lilly read a book on behalf of José, but this may not have been your intended meaning.

"
0	" The first issue is that you have a comma splice instead of using proper punctuation to separate the independent clauses. The second issue is the use of ""do it"" which could be rephrased for clarity or replaced with an appropriate verb form if it doesn't add necessary meaning. Additionally, there seems to be some confusion in the sentence as it implies that Fred won't do something related to the book, but this may not have been your intended meaning. "	" Here's a corrected version with appropriate punctuation and revised phrasing: ""This is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one which Fred refused to read.""
"
0	" The first issue is that you have a comma splice instead of using proper punctuation to separate the independent clauses. The second issue is the use of ""hadn't"" which could be rephrased for clarity or replaced with an appropriate verb form if it doesn't add necessary meaning. Additionally, there seems to be some confusion in the sentence as it implies that Bob mentioned something about you not having read a book, but this may not have been your intended meaning. "	" Here's a corrected version with appropriate punctuation and revised phrasing: ""I know which book Mag read, and I also know which book Bob said you hadn't finished.""
"
0	" The grammar mistakes I see are as follows: ""which book Mag read"" should be ""what book Mag read"" since you're referring to a single item (a book) rather than a group or category of items (books). ""and which book Bob read my report that you hadn't"" can be rephrased for better clarity. It seems like you want to convey that both Mag and Bob read your report, but Bob did so after you had given it to them. A clearer way to express this would be: ""And Bob read my report after I gave it to him."" "	" The corrected version of the sentence could be: ""I know what book Mag read, and I know that Bob read my report after I gave it to him, even though you hadn't seen it yet.""
"
0	" The grammar mistake I see is as follows: ""more than I would cookies"" should be ""more than I do like cookies"" or ""more than I enjoy cookies."" This is because the verb form after ""than"" should agree with the subject (""I"") in its second clause, and not with the object (""cookies""). "	" The corrected version of the sentence could be: ""I'm sure that I would like him to eat fruit more than I do like cookies or enjoy cookies.""
"
0	" The main issue with your original sentence is the use of the present perfect tense (""did talk"") to describe an action (Mary talking about him) that happened in the past, which can be confusing for readers or listeners. Additionally, you need to match the subject and verb agreement between both clauses. "	" The corrected version I provided above is: ""Rusty talked about himself only after Mary had talked about him.""
"
0	" It would be better to say ""Fred talked about everything before Rusty talked about something."" This way, you're using the correct form of the verb ""talk"" in both clauses and making it clear that Fred finished talking before Rusty started. The main issue with your original sentence is the use of the present perfect tense (""did talk"") to describe an action (Rusty talking about something) that happened in the past, which can be confusing for readers or listeners. Additionally, you need to match the subject and verb agreement between both clauses. "	" The corrected version I provided above is: ""Fred talked about everything before Rusty talked about something.""
"
1	 None. 	" The correct version of the sentence remains ""John often meets Mary.""
"
0	" It would be better to say ""The problem is easily perceived."" This way, you're using a more natural verb phrase and making it clear who or what is doing the perceiving. The main issue with your original sentence is the use of the passive voice (""perceives"") without a clear subject performing the action. Additionally, ""easily"" should be an adverb modifying the verb ""perceives,"" not part of the noun phrase ""problem."" "	" The corrected version I provided above is: ""The problem is easily perceived.""
"
1	 None. 	" The correct version of the sentence remains ""A hundred men surrounded the fort.""
"
0	" It would be better to say ""We elected me as..."" or ""They elected me to...,"" depending on the context, to make it clear what position or role you were elected to. The main issue with your original sentence is the use of the pronoun ""me"" without a clear indication of what position or role you were elected to. This can create confusion and sound unnatural in most cases. "	" The corrected version would depend on the context, but here are two possible examples: If you were elected as a representative, the correct version could be: ""We elected me as our representative."" If you were elected to a committee, the correct version could be: ""They elected me to serve on the committee.""
"
0	" The main issue with your original sentence is the placement of the relative clause (""that John was incompetent"") before the subject (""he""). In standard English, we typically use a different word order for questions that involves moving the relative pronoun (in this case, ""which"") to the beginning and placing the verb after the subject. "	" The corrected version I provided above is: ""Which report did he submit that John was incompetent?""
"
1	 None. 	" The correct version of the sentence remains ""Mary has always preferred lemons to limes.""
"
0	" The main issue with your original sentence is the placement of the relative clause (""which were whining"") after the verb ""let,"" which can sound awkward in standard English. Additionally, you need to match the subject and verb agreement between both clauses. "	" The corrected version I provided above is: ""He let the cats out which were whining.""
"
1	 None. 	" The correct version of the sentence remains ""What did Bill buy?""
"
1	 None. 	" The correct version of the sentence remains ""Mary saw the boy walking toward the railroad station.""
"
0	" The main issue with your original sentence is the awkward phrasing and lack of clarity regarding the relationship between ""proof,"" ""the claim,"" and ""John having lied."" Additionally, there should be a comma after ""made"" to separate the two independent clauses. "	" The corrected version I provided above is: ""Proof was given that John had lied, which served as evidence that the claim had been made.""
"
0	" It would be better to say ""He attributed the fire which destroyed most of my factory to a short circuit caused by an overloaded transducer."" This way, you're using a more natural word order and making it clear what he attributed the fire to. The main issue with your original sentence is the awkward phrasing and lack of clarity regarding the relationship between ""he,"" ""the cause,"" and ""the effect"" (i.e., the fire). Additionally, you need to match the subject and verb agreement between both clauses. "	" The corrected version I provided above is: ""He attributed the fire which destroyed most of my factory to a short circuit caused by an overloaded transducer.""
"
0	" It would be better to say ""The mayor regarded the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith as absurd."" This way, you're using a more natural word order and making it clear what he thought about the proposal. The main issue with your original sentence is the placement of the adjective clause (""regarded as being absurd"") before the subject (""the mayor""), which can sound awkward in standard English. Additionally, you need to match the verb tense between both clauses. "	" The corrected version I provided above is: ""The mayor regarded the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith as absurd.""
"
0	" The first error is that ""that"" is unnecessary and can be removed from the sentence. The second error is that ""left"" should be changed to ""leave"" as it's an irregular verb. "	" The correct version of the sentence would be: I want Bill to remain a secret.
"
0	" The first error is that ""who"" should be changed to ""that"" as it's a restrictive relative clause. The second error is that ""drives"" should be changed to ""drive"" as the subject, Tom, is singular and requires a singular verb form. "	" The correct version of the sentence would be: I know a man who Tom drives.
"
0	" The first error is that ""which"" should be changed to ""that"" as it's a restrictive relative clause. The second error is that the verb tense inconsistent, ""are hard to rescue"" should be ""is hard to rescue"" since ""drowning cats"" is singular and requires a singular verb form. "	" The correct version of the sentence would be: Drowning cats, which are against the law, are hard to rescue.
"
0	" The first error is that ""than"" should be changed to ""that"" as it's a conjunction and not needed in this context. The second error is that ""had been insulted"" should be ""has been insulted"" since the past perfect tense implies that Muriel spoke about an event that happened before another past action, which is not clear from the sentence. "	" The correct version of the sentence would be: Muriel said nothing else than that she has been insulted.
"
0	" The first error is that ""Himself"" refers to a male person and it doesn't make sense in this context, you should use a pronoun or noun that makes more sense. The second error is that the subject of the sentence is not clear, who understands Rutherford? "	" The correct version of the sentence would be: He understood by Rutherford.
"
1	  None. 	" The sentence is grammatically correct and it means that you have a feeling or belief that Arch will arrive at some point.
"
0	" The first error is that ""this set"" should be replaced with a more specific noun or pronoun to make it clear what you're referring to, for example ""the proof that this set is recursive"". The second error is the use of the word ""difficult"", which implies that something is challenging to do, but in this context it seems like you are talking about a property of the set and not an action. A more appropriate word would be ""recursive"" or ""self-referential"" "	" The correct version of the sentence could be: ""The proof that this set is recursive is self-referential.""
"
0	" The first error is that ""which"" should be replaced with a comma and a coordinating conjunction such as ""and"", to make it clear that you're talking about multiple things Henry does, for example ""The madrigals and Henry plays the lute and sings sound lousy."" The second error is that the verb tense of the sentence is inconsistent, ""plays"" should be in present simple form since it refers to an action that happens regularly or habitually, while ""sings"" is in past simple form which implies a completed action. "	" The correct version of the sentence could be: ""The madrigals and Henry playing the lute and singing sound lousy.""
"
0	" The first error is that ""and"" should be replaced with a comma and a coordinating conjunction such as ""or"", to make it clear that you're talking about multiple things Tom, Suzie and yourself did, for example ""Tom picked these grapes, I washed some turnips, or Suzie will prepare these grapes."" The second error is the use of the word ""prepare"" which implies that Suzie will get ready to do something with the grapes but it's not clear what she will do exactly, you should use a more specific verb such as ""cook"", ""make into juice"" or ""use in a recipe"". "	" The correct version of the sentence could be: ""Tom picked these grapes, I washed some turnips, and Suzie will cook these grapes.""
"
0	" The first error is that ""and"" should be replaced with a comma and a coordinating conjunction such as ""or"", to make it clear that you're talking about multiple questions, for example ""Where did you go or who ate what?"" The second error is the use of the word ""ate"" which implies that someone consumed food but it's not clear what they ate exactly, you should use a more specific verb such as ""consumed"", ""devoured"" or ""ingested"". "	" The correct version of the sentence could be: ""Where did you go and who consumed what?""
