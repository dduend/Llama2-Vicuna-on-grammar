"
1	". The weights made the rope stretch over the pulley system.  
"
1	". The correct version of the sentence would be ""The mechanical doll wriggled itself free."" Instead of ""loose,"" which is an adjective, you should use ""free,"" which is a verb.
"
1	". ...you might consider rephrasing it to make it more idiomatic. Here's a possible alternative: If you had eaten more, you would feel less hungry.
"
1	". ...I would suggest rephrasing it to make it more idiomatic and easier to understand. Here's a possible revision: As you eat more, you want less. This version is more common and natural-sounding.
"
1	". The correct version of the sentence would be ""The more you want, the less you eat."" This is because ""would"" is not necessary here as it's already implied by ""more"". Additionally, ""you would eat"" should be changed to just ""you eat"" since we are talking about a general trend and not a specific action.
"

"
1	". Here's the corrected sentence: The higher the stakes, the lower his expectations will be.
"
1	". The more appropriate phrase would be ""The more obnoxious Fred is, the less attention you should pay to him."" This is because ""obnoxious"" is an adjective that describes a person's behavior or attitude, and it takes the form of an adverb when used to modify a verb or another adjective. In your sentence, ""obnoxious"" is being used as an adverb modifying the verb ""is.""
"
1	". Here's the correct version of your sentence: John was much more obnoxious than Fred.
"
1	". Here's a corrected version with some minor improvements: The more people you give beer to, the more likely they are to get sick.

"
1	". ...you might consider rephrasing it to make it a bit clearer. Here's one possible revision: The more pictures of him that appear in the news, the more embarrassed John becomes. This version uses parallel structure (both clauses have the same grammatical form) and avoids any potential ambiguity about who is becoming embarrassed.
"
1	". Here's the corrected version of your sentence: Every senator seems to become more corrupt as they talk to more lobbyists.
"
1	". ...you might want to consider rephrasing it for clarity. Here's why:
          The phrase ""Who does John visit Sally because he likes"" is a bit awkward and doesn't convey the intended meaning as clearly as it could be. It would be more natural to say something like, ""John visits Sally because he likes her."" This way, you can avoid any potential confusion about who is doing the visiting and who is being visited.
"
1	". The correct version of the sentence is: Marianne left.
"

"

"
1	". The corrected sentence is: ""I had never seen a place like Bangor before.""
"
1	". ...you might consider rephrasing it to make it more idiomatic. Here's why: 'looked up' is a phrasal verb that typically takes an object, and the word order of your sentence is slightly unusual. A more common way to express this idea would be 'Mickey looked at it.' or 'Mickey gazed at it.'
      "
1	". The correct version of your sentence could be: ""There was a lot of discussion."" or ""There tended to be a lot of discussions."" (Note that the verb tense is changed from present to past, and the word ""discussions"" is added to make it plural.)

"
1	". ...you might consider rephrasing it to make it more idiomatic. Here's a possible alternative: It is nice to travel abroad. This version better reflects the common usage of ""go abroad"" as a synonym for ""travel internationally.""
"
1	". The correct version of the sentence is: Mary intended John to go abroad.
"
1	". ...you might want to consider rephrasing it for clarity. Instead of ""I remembered having kissed Mary,"" you could say ""I remembered kissing Mary."" This is a more direct and concise way to express the idea, and it avoids any potential confusion about the timing of the action (kissing vs. remembering).
      "
1	". ...you might want to consider rephrasing it for clarity. Here's why: 'I can't believe Fred won't' is a bit awkward, and the meaning of the sentence could be more direct. Here's one possible revision: I can't believe Fred didn't. This version is clearer and easier to understand.
      "
1	". ...you might consider rephrasing it to make it more idiomatic. Here's a possible revision: John wants to read Fred's story, and I do too. This version is more common and natural-sounding in English.

"
1	". ...I would suggest changing ""eating cabbage"" to ""eat cabbage."" The verb tense in your original sentence is not consistent, as ""claimed"" is in the past tense while ""eating"" is in the present participle form. To maintain consistency, it's better to use the simple past tense for both verbs. Here's the corrected version: Mary claimed that Holly shouldn't eat cabbage.
"

"
1	". ...you might want to consider rephrasing it for clarity. Here's a possible revision: He attributed the fire that destroyed most of his factory to a short circuit caused by an overloaded transducer.

"
1	". Here's the corrected sentence: The mayor was regarded as absurd the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith.

"
1	". Here's the corrected version of your sentence: The madrigals that Henry plays on the lute and sings sound lousy.
          (Note: I changed ""which"" to ""that,"" added ""on the lute"" to make the phrase more specific, and changed ""sound lousy"" to ""sound terrible."")
"
1	". ...you might want to consider rephrasing it for clarity. Here's why: The phrase ""must have pleased somebody"" is a bit awkward and doesn't quite convey the intended meaning. Instead of using ""pleased,"" you could use ""impressed"" or ""amused."" Additionally, the word ""sometimes"" isn't necessary in this sentence, as it's already implied by the verb tense (Sam didn't sleep). So here's a possible revision: That Sam didn't sleep must have impressed somebody.
"
1	". ...you might want to consider rephrasing it for clarity. Instead of ""about himself,"" you could say ""regarding his own life"" or ""concerning his personal experiences."" This would make the sentence more precise and easier to understand. Here's the corrected version: I talked to Winston about his own life.
"
0	". Here's the corrected version: That the fuzz wanted him worried John, but that the fuzz wanted her didn't worry Mary.
          - Change ""wanted"" to ""had wanted"" because it is a past tense verb and needs the auxiliary verb ""had.""
          - Add an article ""the"" before ""fuzz"" in both clauses for clarity.
          - Use ""didn't"" instead of ""her didn't"" for negation.
"
1	". Here's the corrected sentence: I'll work on it if Sam will be working on it too. (Added 'too' to make the sentence grammatically correct.)
"
1	". The correct version of your sentence is: I will work on it if I can.
"
1	". Sure! Here's the correct version of your sentence: Here's a knife for cutting onions.
"
1	". ...you might want to consider rephrasing it for clarity. Here's why: The phrase ""which not everybody knows"" is a bit awkward and could be misunderstood as ""Fluffy is sick, which some people don't know."" To avoid this potential confusion, you could simply say ""Fluffy is sick, but not everyone knows it."" This version of the sentence is clearer and more natural-sounding.
      3. Here's your original sentence with a few minor adjustments to make it even clearer: Fluffy is sick, but only a few people know it.
"
1	". I would like to point out that ""Maxwell"" should be capitalized because it's a proper noun (the name of a person). Here is the corrected version of your sentence: Maxwell is quite a doctor.
      "
1	". ...you might want to consider using 'tall' instead of 'might have been tall,' as it is a more natural way to express the idea that someone was tall. Additionally, you could use 'the older one was blonde' instead of 'the older one definitely was, blond' to make the sentence more concise and clear. Here's the corrected version:
      The younger woman might have been tall, and the older one was blonde.
"
1	". ...you might consider rephrasing it to make it more clear and concise. Here's a possible revision: Sally is tall, and she may have blonde hair; Sheila is short, and she definitely has blonde hair. This version uses parallel structure (tall/may have, short/definitely has) to make the sentence easier to read and understand.
"
1	". Here's the corrected sentence: I have to try finishing grading some papers.
"
0	". The corrected sentence should be: ""The socks are ready for you to put on.""
"
1	". Here's the corrected sentence: It is easy to play sonatas on this violin.
"
0	". The corrected sentence should read: This violin is difficult to play sonatas on it.
```
  Here's the explanation of the mistake and the correction:

   MISTAKE: In the original sentence, ""sonatas"" is a plural noun, but it is used as a singular noun. To fix this error, we need to change the word order and make ""sonatas"" agree with the verb ""play.""

   CORRECTION: Instead of saying ""This violin is difficult to play sonatas on,"" we should say ""This viol
"
0	". The corrected sentence should be: My mother is easy to please my father.

"
1	". Here's the corrected sentence with some minor improvements: Everybody around here who ever buys anything on credit talks in their sleep.
```
  Can you explain why ""their"" is correct instead of ""his""? What rule or principle applies here?
   "
1	". The correct version of the sentence would be: I can't remember the name of someone who had misgivings.
```
  Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's my answer:
  
1. No. There are no strict grammar mistakes in your sentence. You have used proper subject-verb agreement and the correct form of ""remember."" However, there is a small lexical mistake that you might want to consider fixing.
  
"
1	". Here's the corrected sentence: No writer or playwright meets in Vienna.
"
1	". Here's the corrected sentence: None of the writers or playwrights meets in Vienna.

1	". The correct version of the sentence is: It is not certain that you will marry any student.
"
1	". ...you might want to consider rephrasing it as ""Felicia kicked the ball from the bench"" or ""Felicia kicked the ball off the ground."" Both of these versions convey a more natural and common way of describing the action of kicking a ball.
"
1	". ...you might consider rephrasing it to make it more precise. Here's a possible alternative: I sent the package around halfway across the world. This version emphasizes that the package was sent only part of the way around the globe, rather than all the way.
"
1	". The correct version of the sentence would be: Sam gave the ball out of the basket.
          (Note that ""out of"" is a preposition, and it needs to be followed by a noun or pronoun. In this case, ""the basket"" is the object of the preposition ""out of"".)
"
1	". The correct version of the sentence would be: Sam offered the ball out of the basket.
"
1	". Here's the corrected sentence: Park Square has a festive atmosphere. (Atmosphere is more appropriate than air to describe a place's ambiance.)

          Should I stop here or provide additional explanations? Please let me know!

"
1	". Here's the corrected sentence: Sarah promised Catherine her old car, but then gave it to her son instead of her.
"
1	". ...you might consider rephrasing it to make it more idiomatic. Here's a possible revision: I lent Tony part of the book. This version is more common and natural-sounding in English.

"
1	". Here's the corrected sentence: Jessica loaded the boxes under the wagon.
"
1	". The correct version of the sentence is Jessica loaded the boxes onto the wagon. In this version, we use the preposition ""onto"" instead of ""on"" to indicate that the boxes are being placed inside or on top of something else (in this case, the wagon). Using ""on"" would imply that the boxes are simply resting on the surface of the wagon without being securely fastened.
"
1	". ...you might want to consider rephrasing it for clarity's sake. Here's why: 'crammed boxes at the truck' could be interpreted as either Jessica cramming boxes into the truck or Jessica cramming something else (like clothes) into the boxes, which are then placed at the truck. To make your sentence more specific and clear, you might want to add a preposition like 'into' or 'onto.' For example:
      "
1	". ...you might consider rephrasing it to make it more idiomatic. Instead of ""Lora buttered at the toast,"" you could say ""Lora buttered the toast."" This is a more common and natural way to express this idea.

"
1	". The correct version of the sentence would be: I shaped a loaf of bread.
"
1	". The correct version of the sentence should be ""The children amused themselves.""

"
1	". ...you might consider rephrasing it for clarity. Here's why: ""There presented itself"" is a bit awkward, as the subject of the sentence (the opportunity) is not doing the presenting; rather, it is being presented by someone or something else. A more natural way to phrase this would be:
      CORRECTED SENTENCE: Yesterday, there was a wonderful opportunity that presented itself.
"
1	". ...you might consider rephrasing it to make it a bit more idiomatic. Here's one possible revision: A great opportunity came his way yesterday. This version is a bit more common and natural-sounding, don't you think?
"
1	". ...you might want to consider rephrasing it for clarity's sake. Here's why:
          The phrase ""Out of the box"" is a bit ambiguous and could be interpreted as meaning that the little white rabbit was inside the box before jumping out, which may not have been your intention. To make your sentence clearer, you might want to consider rephrasing it using more specific language. For example:
             A little white rabbit hopped out of a box or A small white rabbit leaped from within a box. These versions convey the idea that the rabbit was inside the box

"
1	". The correct version of your sentence is: ""I saw that the gas can explode."" This change makes it clear that the gas itself can explode, rather than just the fact that you saw something that could potentially explode.
"
1	". ...you might want to consider rephrasing it to make it more idiomatic. The phrase ""He washed her"" is not a common way to express this idea, and it could be misunderstood or sound awkward to native English speakers. A more natural way to say this would be ""He washed her clothes.""
      3. If you'd like me to check for other grammar mistakes in your sentence, please feel free to ask!
"
1	". The correct version of your sentence would be ""Wash yourself!"" instead of ""Wash you!"" This is because the subject of the sentence is ""you,"" which is a second-person pronoun, and it should be paired with the verb ""yourself"" instead of ""wash.""
"
1	". ...you might consider rephrasing it to make it more idiomatic or clearer. For example, you could say ""They lack insight"" instead of ""They have no in."" This would be a more common and natural way to express the idea that they are unable to understand something.
"
1	". ...you might consider rephrasing it to make it more idiomatic. Here's a possible revision: Some of my jobs are in jeopardy. This is more common and natural-sounding than ""Some my jobs."" Additionally, ""jeopardy"" can be a bit formal; you could replace it with ""trouble"" or ""difficulty"" to make the sentence even more conversational. So here's your revised sentence: Some of my jobs are in trouble.
      "
1	". ...you might want to consider rephrasing it for clarity. Instead of ""the policeman met,"" you could say ""the policeman encountered"" or simply ""the policeman saw."" Additionally, you could replace ""several young students"" with ""a group of young students"" for greater precision. Here's the corrected sentence: The policeman encountered a group of young students in the park last night.
"
1	". ...you might consider rephrasing it to make it more idiomatic. Here's a possible revision: Did the policeman meet IN the park? (emphasis added)
      "

1	". Here's the corrected version of your sentence: I don't know if I should agree. (No changes were made.)
"

"
1	". The correct version of the sentence would be: John called the president a foolish person.
"
1	". ...you might want to consider rephrasing it for clarity. Instead of ""I forgot how good beer tastes,"" you could say, ""I had forgotten how good beer tasted."" This version is more idiomatic and easier to understand.

      "
0	". The corrected sentence should be: ""A good friend has remained to me by him.""
  "
1	". The correct version of your sentence would be: John ate his noodles quietly. (Adding an 's' to noodle to make it plural, as noodles is the correct form.)
"
1	". To make the sentence more idiomatic, you could replace ""smith"" with ""blacksmith,"" as ""smith"" can also refer to a metalworker who works with any type of metal, whereas ""blacksmith"" specifically refers to one who works with iron or steel. So the corrected sentence would be: A blacksmith hammered the metal.
      "
1	". The correct version of the sentence is: Sandy removed her ballet slippers.

"
1	". The correct version of the sentence would be: Benny worked at a shoe factory while he was a student.
"
1	". ...you might want to consider rephrasing it for clarity. Here's why:
          The verb ""hope"" is a bit awkward here because it's not clear what everyone hopes will happen. Does everyone hope that she will sing, or do they simply hope that she will perform well? To make the sentence clearer, you could try rephrasing it as follows:
             Everyone anticipated that she would sing. 
"
1	". Here's the corrected sentence: This was a decisive factor. (Note that ""proved"" is not necessary here, as it is implied by ""decisive."")
"
1	". You might want to consider changing 'devoured' to 'ate' or 'consumed,' as 'devour' is a more formal word that may not be familiar to all readers. Here's the corrected sentence: The crocodile ate the doughnut.
"
1	". The correct version of the sentence is: John fears Bill.
"
1	". ...you might consider rephrasing it to make it more idiomatic. Here's a possible alternative: John placed the bathtub under the sink. This version is more common and natural-sounding in English.
"
1	". ...to make it more idiomatic, you could say ""John placed Kim behind the garage."" instead of using ""behind"" as a preposition. It's more common to use ""put"" or ""place"" someone somewhere, especially when referring to physical locations. So the correct version would be: John put Kim behind the garage.

"
1	". The chickens seem to be fond of the farmer (the verb ""seem"" is more appropriate here, as it expresses a possibility or an impression).
"
1	". The correct version of the sentence would be ""The rules require that executives be polite."" Instead of using ""the executives"" (which is a plural noun), you should use ""executives"" (which is an uncountable noun). This will make your sentence more concise and natural-sounding.
"
1	". ...the word ""nominated"" should be followed by a gerund, not an infinitive phrase beginning with ""Bill."" The correct version of the sentence is: That Fred was unpopularly nominated Bill.

0	". The correct version of your sentence should be: They were taking a hard look at possible FTAs. (plural form of ""FTA"" is used to refer to multiple potential free trade agreements.)
"
1	". ...you might want to consider rephrasing it for clarity's sake. The phrase ""against the book"" is a bit ambiguous and could be interpreted as meaning that John paid you money to offset an amount owed to him, rather than paying you directly for something you bought or borrowed from him.
      3. Here's one possible rephrased version of your sentence: ""John paid me for the book."" This makes it clear that he paid you directly for a specific item, rather than offsetting an amount owed to him.
"
1	". Here's the correct version of your sentence: The committee will study the feasibility of setting up a national computer network.
"
1	". ...I would suggest rephrasing it to make it more idiomatic and natural-sounding. Here's a possible revision: We made them act rude. This version better captures the idea that you intentionally caused someone to behave in a certain way, rather than simply being rude themselves.

"
0	". Here's the corrected sentence: That dog is so ferocious that it even tried to bite itself.
```
  This is a good example of how an English teacher might respond when asked if a sentence is grammatically correct and what the correct version of the sentence should be. The assistant would point out one error in the original sentence, which is ""it even tried to bite itself"" because it is not possible for something to try to bite itself, as there is no external entity that can do the biting. Then, they provide a corrected version of the sentence with proper grammar and word choice.
"
0	". The corrected sentence should be: He washed himself.
"
1	". The sentence could be improved by changing 'please' to 'pleased.' Here is the corrected sentence: John is easy to please Kim.

"
1	". The correct version of the sentence is: John tried to please Stephen.
"
1	". ...the phrase ""to be"" is usually not used to describe physical objects like fountains, as it implies a more abstract or metaphorical meaning. Instead of ""a fountain,"" you might consider using a more concrete noun like ""a statue"" or ""a water feature."" So the correct version of your sentence could be: We believed John to be a statue in the park.
      3. Alternatively, if you want to keep the phrase ""to be"" and refer to John as a fountain figuratively (e.g., because he is a source of wisdom or creativity), you might consider re

"
1	". ...you might consider rephrasing it to make it more idiomatic. Here's a possible alternative: There are believed to be sheep grazing in the park. This version uses the more common verb ""graze"" instead of ""be,"" which is more likely to be used in everyday conversation.
      "
1	". ...I would suggest changing ""would"" to ""will."" The verb tense in your sentence is not consistent, as you use the present simple (""hope"") but also the past simple (""study""). To make it more coherent, change ""would"" to ""will"": I hope to study in France.
      3. (Bonus) If you want to express a future intention that is not yet certain or confirmed, you could use the present continuous instead of the simple present: I hope to be studying in France. This would convey more uncertainty and tentativeness about your plans.
"
1	". The correct version of the sentence is: John can kick the ball well.
"
1	". Yes. Here's the corrected version of your sentence: John will rain tomorrow.
"
1	". The correct version of your sentence should be ""We expect it to rain."" instead of ""We expect there to will rain."" You can use the present simple tense instead of the future simple tense, and you don't need to repeat ""to"" before ""rain"".
"

"
1	". ...you might consider rephrasing it to make it more idiomatic. Here's a possible revision: As a statesman, he could hardly do anything worth mentioning. This version uses the word ""hardly"" instead of ""scarcely,"" which is more commonly used in this context.

"
0	". Here's the corrected sentence: The bed was slept on.
"
1	". ...you might want to consider rephrasing it for clarity's sake, as ""a pound"" is a unit of weight and ""the book"" doesn't make sense as something that can weigh things. Here's one possible revision: A pound was weighed on the scale.

"
1	". ...I would suggest rephrasing it to make it more idiomatic and easier to understand. Here's a possible revision: Which topic did you get bored with because Mary talked about it? This version uses the more common phrase ""get bored with"" instead of ""get bored because,"" which makes the sentence sound more natural and flows better.
"
1	". The correct version of the sentence is: That is the reason why he resigned.
"
1	". You might consider rephrasing it to make it more idiomatic. Here's why:
          The verb ""bothers"" is a bit formal for everyday speech, and it can also sound a bit judgmental (as if you find John's coughing to be bothersome or annoying). Instead of using ""bothers,"" you could use the more neutral word ""concerns."" Here's the corrected sentence:
          It concerns me that John coughs.
"
1	". To please John is easy could be rephrased as It's easy to please John, which might convey the same meaning more clearly and naturally.
"
1	". The correct version of the sentence is: Kim is eager to please Tom.
"
1	". ...you might consider rephrasing it to make it more idiomatic. Here's a suggestion: That our invasion of Iraq really bites. This version uses the word ""our"" instead of ""we,"" which is more appropriate when referring to a collective action taken by a group or nation.
      3. Additionally, you might want to consider using a different verb tense in your sentence. The phrase ""really bites"" is somewhat informal and could be replaced with a more formal expression. For example: That our invasion of Iraq has had severe consequences. This version uses the present perfect tense to

  "
1	". The correct version of your sentence could be: ""The one with the red cover takes a very long time to read."" (Note that I changed ""a"" to ""the"" before ""red cover"" because ""a"" is used for countable nouns, and ""red cover"" is an uncountable noun.)
      "
1	". The correct version of the sentence is: John has a fear of dogs.
"
1	". The correct version of the sentence should be: The building's roof is leaking. You have used a singular verb (is) with a plural subject (the building's), which is not grammatically incorrect but can sound awkward to native speakers.

          The structure of your sentence is a bit confusing, as ""The man I saw get into the cab"" could be interpreted as either ""I saw the man getting into the cab"" or ""I saw the man who got into the cab."" To avoid any confusion, you might want to use a different word order.
          Here's an example of how you could rephrase your sentence for greater clarity: ""The man I saw entered the cab and robbed the bank."" This version makes it clear that
"
1	". The correct version of the sentence would be: I know you eat asparagus. (No change needed.)
"
1	". ...you might want to consider rephrasing it for clarity. The word ""bother"" can be a bit ambiguous here, as it could imply that John's drum is causing you emotional distress or annoyance. If that's not what you meant, you might want to choose a different verb to convey your intended meaning. For example:
          Corrected sentence: John's drumming will always irritate me. (Here, ""irritate"" more clearly conveys the idea of being annoyed or distracted by something.)
"

In this version, we've added the word ""should"" to indicate that Heidi is making a recommendation or suggestion, rather than simply stating what Andy does or doesn't do. This makes the sentence more clear and natural-sounding.
"

"
1	". The correct version of your sentence should be ""Who has Peter talked to?"" instead of ""Who has Peter talked with?"" because ""with"" is a preposition that indicates location or association, and it doesn't fit well in this context. Instead, you can use the verb ""spoken"" which is in the past tense, and it agrees better with the subject ""Peter"".
      3. Additionally, if you want to ask about multiple people, you could say ""Who has Peter talked to?"" instead of just asking about one person.
"

          The phrase ""on duty today"" is a bit ambiguous and could be interpreted as referring to the pilot's current schedule or shift, rather than their availability to fly the plane. To make your sentence more clear, you might want to use ""available"" instead of ""on duty."" So, the corrected sentence would be:
          Any pilot available today could be flying this plane.

"
1	". ...I would suggest rephrasing it to make it more idiomatic. Here's a possible alternative: The idea dismayed the Prime Minister that the Dome was too dull. This version uses ""too"" instead of ""dull,"" which is more common in everyday speech and easier to understand for native English speakers.

"
1	". ...you might consider rephrasing it to make it clearer. Here's a possible revision: John heard that they had criticized themselves.

1	". ...you might want to consider rephrasing it for clarity. Here's why:
          - The phrase ""while you did so"" is a bit awkward and could be simplified. Instead of using ""did so,"" you could just say ""whiles."" So, the sentence could become: I saw Bill while Mary was doing something else. This way, it flows better and is easier to understand.
      3. Additionally, some people might find the use of ""while"" in this context a bit confusing. It's not a strict grammar mistake, but it could be improved for clarity.

```
  Can you explain what the mistakes were in the original sentence and how they were corrected? Specifically, I would like to know about the following issues:
   - Use of ""extremely"" as an adverb modifying a verb (frantically) instead of an adjective modifying an adverb.
   - Use of ""at Trade 1"" instead of ""at Trade One.""
   - The missing article ""the"" before ""Trade One"".
   - The incorrect use of the word ""danced""
"
1	". The correct version of your sentence would be: What did Medea give to whom?
"
1	". The correct version of your sentence is: It's Anson that I like the most. This phrase ""the most"" is an idiomatic expression used to indicate a high level of preference or affection for someone or something.
