"
1	 None. 	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""If you had eaten more, you would want less.""
"
0	" The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is logically inconsistent. The subject ""you"" is used twice in the sentence, which can cause confusion about which ""you"" is being referred to. Additionally, the relationship between ""eat the most"" and ""want the least"" is not clear. It is not clear if the sentence is trying to say that the more you eat, the less you want, or if it is trying to say that the person who eats the most does not want the least. "	" The correct version of the sentence would depend on the intended meaning, but one possible correction could be: ""The more you eat, the less you want."" This version uses the word ""the"" before ""more"" to clarify that it is referring to a quantity, and it uses the word ""less"" instead of ""least"" to clarify that it is referring to a decrease in desire.
"

"
0	" The subject of the sentence is ""John,"" which is singular, but the verb ""eat"" should be in its plural form to agree with the subject. Additionally, the sentence is logically inconsistent because it is not clear how the amount of food consumed by John relates to the amount of money he pays. "	" The correct version of the sentence would depend on the intended meaning, but one possible correction could be: ""I demand that the more John eats, the more he pays."" This version uses the word ""the"" before ""more"" to clarify that it is referring to a quantity, and it uses the singular form of ""eats"" to agree with the singular subject ""John."" However, it is still unclear how the amount of food consumed by John relates to the amount of money he pays.

"
0	" The subject of the sentence is ""his expectations,"" which is singular, but the verb ""are"" should be in its singular form to agree with the subject. Additionally, the sentence is logically inconsistent because it is not clear how the stakes relate to the expectations. "	" The correct version of the sentence would depend on the intended meaning, but one possible correction could be: ""The higher the stakes, the lower his expectations."" This version uses the word ""lower"" to indicate a decrease in expectations, and it uses the singular form of ""his expectations"" to agree with the singular subject. However, it is still unclear how the stakes relate to the expectations.
"
1	 The sentence is grammatically correct, but it could be improved by rephrasing to make it clearer. 	" The correct version of the sentence could be: ""The more obnoxious Fred is, the less attention you should pay to him.""

"
0	" The subject of the sentence is ""people,"" which is plural, but the verb ""get"" should be in its singular form to agree with the subject. Additionally, the sentence is logically inconsistent because it is not clear how giving beer to more people leads to more people getting sick. "	" The correct version of the sentence would depend on the intended meaning, but one possible correction could be: ""The more people you give beer to, the more likely it is that they will get sick."" This version uses the word ""likely"" to indicate a probability, and it clarifies that the relationship between giving beer and getting sick is not necessarily causal.
"
0	" The subject of the sentence should be ""Bill's smoking"" or ""the amount of smoking"" rather than ""Bill"" because the sentence is trying to convey a cause-and-effect relationship between Bill's smoking and Susan's hatred, and the subject of the sentence should be the thing causing the effect. "	" The correct version of the sentence could be: ""The more Bill smokes, the more Susan hates his smoking."" or ""The more Bill smokes, the more Susan hates the amount of smoke he produces.""
"
0	" The subject of the sentence should be ""the appearance of pictures of him"" or ""the news reports about him"" rather than ""pictures of him"" because the sentence is trying to convey a cause-and-effect relationship between the news coverage of him and John's embarrassment, and the subject of the sentence should be the thing causing the effect. "	" The correct version of the sentence could be: ""The more the news reports about him, the more embarrassed John becomes."" or ""The more the appearance of pictures of him in the news, the more embarrassed John becomes.""
"
0	" The subject of the sentence should be ""the senators"" rather than ""senator"" because the sentence is talking about multiple senators, not just one. Also, the verb ""become"" should be in its plural form ""become"" to match the plural subject ""the senators."" "	" The correct version of the sentence could be: ""It seems that every senator becomes more corrupt as he talks to more lobbyists."" or ""Many senators seem to become more corrupt as they talk to more lobbyists.""
"
0	" The subject of the sentence should be ""John's visit to Sally"" rather than ""John"" because the sentence is trying to convey who John visits Sally because of, and the subject of the sentence should be the thing being visited. Also, the verb ""likes"" should be in its gerund form ""liking"" to function as the object of the preposition ""because."" "	" The correct version of the sentence could be: ""John visits Sally because he likes her."" or ""John's visit to Sally is because he likes her.""

"
0	" The subject of the sentence ""he"" is a singular pronoun and does not agree with the plural verb ""have been working."" Also, the sentence is in the present tense but trying to express past possibility, which requires the use of the past perfect tense. "	" The correct version of the sentence could be: ""He could not have been working."" or ""He may not have been working.""

"
0	" The grammar mistake is that ""escaped"" is not the correct verb form to use with the subject ""tube."" Also, ""gas"" is an uncountable noun, so it should not be preceded by an article. "	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""The gas escaped from the tube.""
"
1	 None. 	" The correct version of the sentence is ""Water bubbled up out of the kettle.""

0	" The grammar mistake is that the sentence is not clear about what ""leave"" and ""stay"" refer to. It is unclear whether Mary and Sue are being asked to leave or stay in a specific location or whether they are being asked to leave or stay in their current positions or statuses. "	" The correct version of the sentence depends on the intended meaning. If Mary and Sue are being asked to leave or stay in a specific location, the sentence could be: ""We persuaded Mary to leave the party and Sue to stay at home."" If Mary and Sue are being asked to leave or stay in their current positions or statuses, the sentence could be: ""We persuaded Mary to leave her job and Sue to stay in her position.""

"
0	" The grammar mistake is a lack of agreement in the number between the subject ""This is the book"" and the two pronouns ""which Bob reviewed"" and ""which Fred won't do it."" The subject is singular (the book), so the pronouns should also be singular (which Bob reviewed, and this is the one which Fred won't review). "	" Here is the corrected version of the sentence: ""This is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one which Fred won't review.""
"
0	" The grammar mistake is a lack of agreement in the number between the subject ""I know"" and the two pronouns ""which book Mag read"" and ""which book Bob said that you hadn't.""

"
0	" The grammar mistake is a lack of agreement in the number between the subject ""I know"" and the two pronouns ""which book Mag read"" and ""which book Bob read my report that you hadn't.""

"	" Here is the corrected version of the sentence: ""I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob read my report that you hadn't.""
"
0	" The grammar mistake is the use of the word ""more"" in the sentence. When comparing two things, you need to use ""than"" to make a comparison.

"

"
0	" The grammar mistake is the use of the word ""did"" in the sentence. The past tense of the verb ""talk"" is ""talked,"" not ""did talk."" "	" Here is the corrected version of the sentence: ""Fred talked about everything before Rusty talked about something.""
"
1	 None. 	" The sentence is grammatically correct.
"
0	" The grammar mistake is the use of the word ""perceives"" in the sentence.  The verb ""perceive"" is intransitive, meaning it does not take an object. The sentence is missing an object for the verb ""perceives."" "	" Here is the corrected version of the sentence: ""The problem is easily perceived.""
"
1	 None. 	" The sentence is grammatically correct.
"
0	" The grammar mistake is the use of the word ""me"" in the sentence. The subject of the sentence is ""we,"" which is a plural pronoun, meaning that the verb should agree in number with the subject. "	" The correct verb to use in this sentence is ""elected us."" Here is the corrected version of the sentence: ""We elected us.""
"
0	" The grammar mistake is the use of the word ""did"" in the sentence. The past tense of the verb ""submit"" is ""submitted,"" not ""did submit."" "	" Here is the corrected version of the sentence: ""Which report that John was incompetent did he submit?""
"
1	 None. 	" The sentence is grammatically correct.
"
0	" The grammar mistake is the lack of agreement in the number between the subject ""he"" and the object of the preposition ""out.""

"
1	 None. 	" The sentence is already grammatically correct. It is a simple question that uses the correct subject-verb agreement and sentence structure.
"
1	 None. 	" The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a complete sentence with a subject (""Mary""), a verb (""saw""), and a prepositional phrase (""the boy walking toward the railroad station""). The verb ""saw"" agrees in number with the subject ""Mary,"" indicating that the sentence is in the past tense. The phrase ""walking toward the railroad station"" provides additional information about the boy that Mary saw.
"
0	" The main grammar mistake in the sentence is the use of the phrase ""was given"" to introduce the proof that John had lied. This phrase is not necessary and is not grammatically correct in this context. "	" The correct version of the sentence would be: ""A proof that the claim had been made was provided, which showed that John had lied.""
"
0	" There are two main grammar mistakes in the sentence: The phrase ""which was caused by an overloaded transducer"" should be set off with commas to show that it is nonessential to the meaning of the sentence. This is known as a parenthetical expression. The phrase ""the fire which destroyed most of my factory"" is also set off with commas, but this time it is essential to the meaning of the sentence. The correct punctuation for this phrase is to use a pair of dashes, like this: ""He attributed the fire which destroyed most of my factory -- to a short circuit caused by an overloaded transducer."" "	" The correct version of the sentence would be: ""He attributed the fire -- caused by an overloaded transducer -- to a short circuit which destroyed most of my factory.""
"
1	 None. 	" The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a complete sentence with a subject (""the mayor""), a verb (""regarded""), and a prepositional phrase (""as being absurd the proposal""). The phrase ""as being absurd"" is a complement that explains why the mayor regarded the proposal as absurd. The sentence is written in standard English and is easy to understand.
"
0	" The main grammar mistake in the sentence is the use of the word ""left"" instead of ""leave."" ""Left"" is a past participle and should be used with a helping verb such as ""has"" or ""had"" to form a complete tense. "	" The correct version of the sentence would be: ""I want that Bill leave to remain a secret.""
"
0	" There are two main grammar mistakes in the sentence: The subject of the sentence should be ""I,"" not ""Tom."" The sentence should be written in chronological order with the subject coming first. The verb ""drives"" is repeated unnecessarily. The phrase ""as drives"" should be replaced with ""as he drives."" The phrase ""as he drives"" is a subordinate clause that explains how the man drives. "	" The sentence could be rewritten as two separate sentences for clarity: ""I know a man who he drives, and he drives in a particular way.""
"
0	" There are two main grammar mistakes in the sentence: The phrase ""drowning cats"" should be rewritten as ""cats that are drowning"" to make the sentence clearer. The word ""are"" should be replaced with ""is"" because ""cats"" is a singular noun. The phrase ""which is against the law"" is a subordinate clause that explains why it is hard to rescue the drowning cats. "	" The sentence could be rewritten as two separate sentences for clarity: ""Cats that are drowning are hard to rescue. It is against the law to drown cats.""
"
0	" The sentence is missing an article before ""than."" "	" ""Muriel said nothing but that she had been insulted.""

"
0	 The subject of the first and third clause (Tom, Suzie) does not agree with the verb in the second clause (washed, will prepare). The verb in the second clause should be in the plural form to match the plural subject (Tom, Suzie). 	" None. The original sentence is already grammatically correct.
"
0	" There are two grammar mistakes in the sentence: The phrase ""and who ate what"" is not grammatically correct. It should be ""and who ate what?"" to form a question. The word ""ate"" should be in the past tense since it is referring to an action that has already been completed. "	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""Where did you go and who ate what?""
"
0	" The sentence has several grammar mistakes: The possessive pronoun ""boy's"" should be replaced with the possessive adjective ""boy's"" to correctly modify ""did."" The phrase ""guardian's employer president"" is not grammatically correct. It should be ""guardian's employer and president"" to form a noun phrase. The verb ""elect"" should be in its past participle form ""elected"" to correctly indicate the completed action. "	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""Which boy's did we elect guardian's employer and president?""
"
1	 None. 	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""How sane is Peter?""
"
0	" The grammar mistake in the sentence is that the conjunction ""too"" is not needed after ""Hudson River."" "	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the River, and my dad lives at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River.""
"
0	" The grammar mistake in the sentence is that the pronoun ""it"" does not have a clear antecedent. "	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River, and my dad lives there too.""
"
0	" The grammar mistake in the sentence is that the verb ""make up"" requires a direct object to complete its meaning. "	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""Who is she trying to make up to now?""
"
0	" The grammar mistakes in the sentence are: The verb ""get"" should be in its past participle form ""gotten"" to correctly indicate the completed action. The preposition ""of"" should be replaced with ""have"" to form a grammatically correct phrase. The phrase ""to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam"" should be set off with a pair of commas to form a parenthetical clause. "	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""Wind was gotten to have a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam.""
"
1	 There are no grammar mistakes in the sentence. 	"  The correct version of the sentence is: ""Mike talked about politics yesterday to my friends.""

"
0	" The verb ""donated"" is in the past tense, but the phrase ""for the convicts to build cages with"" is a gerund phrase functioning as the object of the verb.

"
0	" The negative contraction ""won't"" is not the correct form of the verb ""have"". The correct form of the verb to negate the sentence would be ""will not have"". "	" The correct version of the sentence would be: ""I will not have some money.""
"
1	 Your sentence is grammatically correct. 	" The correct version of the sentence would be: ""Do you believe the claim that somebody was looking for something?""
"
0	" The verb ""tried"" is in the past simple tense, but the phrase ""to force me to give her any money"" is in the present participle form, functioning as the object of the verb. The correct form of the verb to agree with the present participle phrase would be ""attempted"". "	" The correct version of the sentence would be: ""I won't ask you to believe that he attempted to force me to give her any money.""
"
1	 None. 	" The sentence is grammatically correct. However, depending on the context, it may be possible to rephrase it for clarity. For example, if it is unclear who ""somebody"" refers to, it could be rewritten as: ""That Sam sometimes didn't sleep must have pleased someone.""

"
0	" There are multiple grammar mistakes in the sentence: The use of ""that"" before ""the fuzz"" is unnecessary and incorrect. The use of ""wanted"" twice in the same sentence is repetitive and incorrect. The subject of the second clause (""her"") is not clear, and it is unclear who or what is being referred to. "	" The correct version of the sentence would be: ""That the fuzz wanted him worried and did not want her to worry Mary.""
"
1	 None. 	" The sentence is grammatically correct, but it could be rephrased for clarity and to avoid possible confusion. Depending on the context, it may be possible to rephrase it as: ""If Sam will be working on it, I'll work on it too."" or ""I'll work on it if and only if Sam is working on it.""
"
1	 None. 	" The sentence is grammatically correct. However, depending on the context, it may be possible to rephrase it for clarity. For example, if it is unclear what ""it"" refers to, it could be rewritten as: ""I'll work on the task if I can."" or ""I'll work on the project if I am able to.""
"
0	" There are two grammar mistakes in the sentence: The use of ""with which"" is incorrect. ""With which"" is a preposition that typically introduces a clause, not a noun phrase. The verb ""cut up"" is in the infinitive form, which is not typically used in this context. Instead, ""cut"" should be used as a verb in its base form, and ""the onions"" should be specified as what is being cut. "	" The correct version of the sentence would be: ""Here's a knife for you to cut the onions with."" Note: Depending on the context, it may be possible to rephrase the sentence for clarity, such as: ""Here's a knife you can use to cut the onions."" or ""Here's a knife for you to chop the onions with.""
"
1	 None. 	" The sentence is grammatically correct.  However, it could be rephrased for clarity, depending on the context.

"
0	" There are two grammar mistakes in the sentence: The use of ""quite"" to modify ""doctor"" is incorrect. ""Quite"" is an adverb that typically modifies verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, not nouns. The verb ""is"" is in the present tense, which is not appropriate for describing someone's occupation or profession. Instead, ""was"" or ""were"" should be used in the present perfect tense to indicate that Maxwell has been a doctor for some time. "	" The correct version of the sentence would be: ""Maxwell is a quite good doctor."" or ""Maxwell is a skilled doctor.""
"
0	" There are two grammar mistakes in the sentence: The use of ""and, and"" is incorrect. It should be ""and"", not "", and"". The verb ""was"" should be in the past perfect tense to indicate that the older woman's blondness was a state that existed before another past action. "	" The correct version of the sentence would be: ""The younger woman might have been tall, and the older one definitely was blond.""
"
0	" There are two grammar mistakes in the sentence: The use of ""and may be"" is incorrect. ""May be"" is a redundant phrase, as ""tall"" already implies possibility. The verb ""is"" should be in the plural form ""are"" to match the subject ""Sheila and Sally"". "	" The correct version of the sentence would be: ""Sally is tall, and Sheila is short. Sally may be blond, and Sheila definitely is blond.""
"
1	 None. 	" The sentence is grammatically correct.  However, depending on the context, it may be possible to rephrase it for clarity.
