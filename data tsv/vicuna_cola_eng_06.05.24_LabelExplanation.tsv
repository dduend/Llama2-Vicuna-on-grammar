label	explanation
0	" The problem is with the preposition ""of"" in the phrase ""clear of the rocks."" ""Of"" is not typically used to indicate a direction or location in this context. Instead, you could say ""clear from the rocks"" or ""clear away from the rocks.""
"
0	" The problem is with the verb tense. The sentence suggests that the weights are currently making the rope stretch over the pulley, but the verb ""made"" implies that this action has already been completed in the past. To fix the sentence, you could use the present continuous tense for ""made"" to indicate ongoing action: The weights are making the rope stretch over the pulley. Alternatively, you could use the simple past tense to indicate a completed action in the past: The weights made the rope stretch over the pulley.
"
0	" The problem is with the word order. The phrase ""wriggled itself loose"" should be ""loose, it wriggled itself."" In English, the general word order for a sentence like this is ""subject-verb-object,"" so the subject ""doll"" should come before the verb ""wriggled."" The corrected sentence would be: The mechanical doll loosened itself.
"
1	" Your sentence is written in the hypothetical conditional form, which is used to talk about situations that are not real but could be. The sentence suggests that if the person had eaten more, they would want less now. This makes sense because if someone is very full, they may not feel hungry for more food.
"
0	" The problem is with the word order. The sentence should be ""As you eat more, you want less."" In English, we use the present participle form of the verb ""to eat"" as the subject complement for the verb ""eat"" in this type of sentence, and we put the adjective ""more"" before the noun ""eat"" to indicate the condition.
"
1	" Your sentence uses the ""more"" and ""less"" construction, which is a common way to express opposite ideas in English. The sentence suggests that if someone wants more of something, they would eat less of it. This makes sense because if someone is really hungry for something, they might eat more of it. But if they have already had enough, they might not want to eat more even if they want it.
"
0	" The verb ""eat"" should be in its base form ""eats"" because it is the second verb in the sentence and follows the adverb ""more."" The subject of the second clause ""he pays"" should be ""John"" to make the sentence clear, instead of leaving it as ""he."" The sentence is a bit awkwardly constructed, and it might be clearer if you rephrased it.
"
0	" The verb ""gets"" should be in its base form ""get"" because it is the second verb in the sentence and follows the adverb ""when."" The sentence is written in the present tense, but it would be more appropriate in the present continuous tense because the action of listening to the Grateful Dead is ongoing.

"
0	" The grammar mistake is that the verb ""does"" should be in agreement with the subject ""Bill"" in number (singular or plural). Since ""Bill"" is singular, the correct form of the verb should be ""smokes"", not ""does"". Additionally, the verb ""hates"" should agree in number with the subject ""Susan"", which is also singular. Therefore, the correct sentence would be: ""The more Bill smokes, the more Susan hates him.""

0	" The grammar mistake is that the sentence is in the interrogative form (question), but it is missing the subject pronoun ""he"" before the phrase ""likes"". Additionally, the verb ""visit"" should be in its base form, ""visits"", as it is the third person singular present tense form. Therefore, the correct sentence would be: ""Why does John visit Sally?

"
0	" The grammar mistake in your sentence is the use of the past participle ""escaped"" instead of the base form ""escape"" to agree with the subject ""tube."" The correct sentence would be ""The tube escaped by gas"" or ""The gas escaped through the tube,"" depending on the intended meaning.

"
0	" The grammar mistake in your sentence is the use of the word ""whole"" to modify ""bottle."" The word ""whole"" means ""complete"" or ""entire,"" and it does not fit well with the intended meaning of the sentence. A possible correction to your sentence is to use ""all"" instead of ""whole"" to indicate that the water filled the entire bottle. For example, ""What the water did to all of the bottle was fill it."" Another possible correction is to use ""the entire"" instead of ""the whole"" to emphasize that the filling occurred throughout the entire bottle. For example, ""What the water did to the entire bottle was fill it.""
"
0	" The grammar mistake in your sentence is the lack of a definite article ""the"" before ""fluid."" The correct sentence would be ""The tank leaked the fluid free"" to indicate a specific fluid. Additionally, the phrase ""free"" is not a verb and does not fit well with the intended meaning of the sentence. It is unclear what you intended to convey with ""free,"" but it is possible that you meant to use a verb such as ""flow"" or ""drip"" to describe the action of the fluid. For example, ""The tank leaked the fluid and it flowed free.""

0	" The grammar mistake in your sentence is the use of the word ""even"" to mean ""in spite of the fact that."" It is followed by the subordinating conjunction ""though"" and the clause ""the courts didn't actually find Klaus guilty of murder."" A possible correction to your sentence is to remove the word ""even"" and use the conjunction ""though"" to connect the two clauses. For example, ""Most people probably consider, though the courts didn't actually find, Klaus guilty of murder."" Another possible correction is to replace ""probably"" with ""likely"" to make the sentence more formal and precise. For example, ""Most people likely consider, though the courts didn't actually find, Klaus guilty of murder.""
"
0	" The grammar mistake in your sentence is the use of the word ""beautifully"" to modify the verb ""plays."" It is an adverb that is typically used to describe the manner in which a verb is performed, but it is not appropriate in this context. A possible correction to your sentence is to use the adverb ""well"" to describe the manner in which Mary plays the violin. For example, ""Mary plays the violin well."" Another possible correction is to use the adverb ""gracefully"" to emphasize the elegance and beauty of Mary's playing. For example, ""Mary plays the violin gracefully.""
"
0	" The grammar mistakes in your sentence are the use of the adverb ""probably"" and the word ""perfectly"" to modify the verb ""learn."" ""Probably"" is a word that means ""with a likelihood of something,"" but it is not appropriate in this context because it is used to describe the future tense of the verb ""learn."" Instead, you can use words such as ""definitely,"" ""certainly,"" or ""surely"" to indicate that John will learn French immediately. ""Perfectly"" is an adverb that means ""to a high degree,"" but it is not appropriate in this context because it is used to describe the manner in which John will learn French. Instead, you can use words such as ""quickly,"" ""easily,"" or ""effortlessly"" to indicate how John will learn French. A possible correction to your sentence is to remove the word ""probably"" and use the word ""quickly"" to indicate the speed at which John will learn French. For example, ""Clearly, John will immediately learn French quickly."" Another possible correction is to remove the word ""perfectly"" and use the word ""easily"" to indicate the ease at which John will learn French. For example, ""Clearly, John will immediately learn French effortlessly.""
"
0	" The grammar mistake is that the verb ""gave"" should agree in number with its subject ""Sue."" Since ""Sue"" is singular, the verb should also be singular. Therefore, the correct sentence would be: ""Sue gave a book to Bill.""

"
0	" The grammar mistakes are The use of the article ""a"" before ""genuine linguist"" is incorrect. It should be ""as a genuine linguist"" without the article ""a."" The verb ""represented"" should be in its past participle form ""represented"" to function as a past participle adjective in the phrase ""as a genuine linguist."" The word ""seriously"" should be in its adverb form ""seriously"" to modify the verb ""represented.""
"
0	" The grammar mistake is that the subject of the sentence is missing. The correct subject should be ""we"" (referring to the person or people using the pronoun ""us"") instead of ""they."" Therefore, the sentence should be: ""We love they."" However, it is important to note that the sentence is still grammatically incorrect because the verb ""love"" should be in its correct form ""loves"" to agree with the subject ""we."" The correct sentence would be: ""We love them.""

"
0	" The grammar mistake is that the sentence is in the wrong order. The correct sentence should be: ""I can't believe that Fred won't, either."" The use of the word ""either"" implies that there are two options, but the sentence is missing the second option. By reordering the sentence, the meaning becomes clearer: ""I can't believe that Fred won't"" (I find it hard to believe that Fred won't) ""either"" (or that he would not).

"
0	" The grammar mistake is that the verb ""should"" is in the wrong tense. The correct verb tense for a past action with a reported speech is the past participle form ""should have"" or ""should have been"" depending on the tense of the original verb. Therefore, the correct sentence should be: ""Mary claimed that eating cabbage, Holly shouldn't have."" Additionally, it would be more natural to use ""is not recommended"" instead of ""shouldn't"" to make a general recommendation or advice. Therefore, the corrected sentence could be: ""Mary claimed that eating cabbage is not recommended for Holly.""
"
0	" The grammar mistake is the use of the phrase ""to be introduced"" in the second clause. The correct form would be ""to be introduced to"" or ""to meet"" depending on the intended meaning. Assuming that you want to convey the meaning that you both came to meet the bartender, the corrected sentence would be: ""Mary came to be introduced to the bartender, and I also came to meet him."" Both ""Mary"" and ""I"" would use the third-person singular form ""him"" as the object of the verb ""meet.""
"
1	" None
"
0	" The grammar mistake is the use of the singular form ""neuroses"" to refer to a plural concept. ""Neuroses"" is a singular noun that refers to a specific mental disorder. To refer to multiple neuroses, the correct form would be ""neuroses"" or ""neurotic tendencies."" Assuming that you want to convey the meaning that multiple neuroses or neurotic tendencies bother his patrons, the corrected sentence would be: ""Joe's neuroses and neurotic tendencies bother his patrons, and Sally does too.""
"
0	" The grammar mistake is that the sentence is not clear about who did what. The sentence is written in a way that suggests both José and Lilly did something for class, but it's not clear what each of them did. To make the sentence grammatically correct and clear, you could consider rephrasing it like this: ""I know which book José didn't read for class, and I also know which book Lilly read for him.""
"
0	" There are two grammar mistakes in your sentence: ""This is the book which Bob reviewed"" should be ""This is the book that Bob reviewed"" because ""book"" is a singular noun, and ""which"" is used for non-restrictive clauses, which this clause is not. ""This is the one which Fred won't do it"" should be ""This is the one that Fred won't do"" because ""one"" is a singular noun, and ""that"" is used for restrictive clauses, which this clause is not.
"
0	" There are two grammar mistakes in your sentence: ""which book Mag read"" should be ""that Mag read"" because ""book"" is a singular noun, and ""that"" is used for restrictive clauses, which this clause is not. ""which book Bob said that you hadn't"" should be ""that Bob said you hadn't"" because ""book"" is a singular noun, and ""that"" is used for restrictive clauses, which this clause is not. In addition, the word ""haven't"" should be in the present perfect tense ""hadn't"" to match the past tense of the verb ""said"".
"
0	" There are two grammar mistakes in your sentence: ""which book Bob read my report that you hadn't"" should be ""that Bob read my report that you hadn't"" because ""book"" is a singular noun, and ""that"" is used for restrictive clauses, which this clause is not. The word ""read"" should be in the past tense ""read"" to match the time frame of the sentence. In addition, the word ""haven't"" should be in the present perfect tense ""hadn't"" to match the past tense of the verb ""read"".
"
0	" There is one grammar mistake in your sentence: ""I'm sure I would like him to eat fruit more than I would cookies"" should be ""I'm sure I would like him to eat more fruit than cookies"" because the subject of the sentence is ""I"" and the verb is ""would like,"" so the verb should agree in number with the subject. In addition, the word ""eat"" should be in the base form because it is the main verb of the sentence.
"
0	" There is one grammar mistake in your sentence: ""Rusty talked about himself only after Mary did talk about him"" should be ""Rusty talked about himself only after Mary talked about him"" because the past participle of the verb ""talk"" is ""talked,"" not ""did talk."" In addition, the word ""did"" is unnecessary because ""talk"" is already in the past tense.
"
0	" The correct sentence would be: ""Fred talked about everything before Rusty talked about something."" The verb ""talk"" is in the past tense, so it needs to be consistent throughout the sentence. Additionally, the subject ""Rusty"" is singular, so the verb ""did"" should be in the singular form ""talked"" instead of ""did talk.""
"
1	" The sentence is in the present simple tense, which is used to describe habits or routines. ""Often"" is an adverb that indicates frequency, and ""meets"" is a verb in the present simple tense. The subject ""John"" and the object ""Mary"" are both singular, so the verb ""meets"" is in the singular form.
"
0	" The correct sentence would be: ""The problem is easily perceived."" The verb ""perceives"" should be in the third person singular form ""is"" to agree with the subject ""problem."" Additionally, the verb ""perceived"" should be in the past participle form to function as the past participle of the verb ""perceive.""
"
1	" The sentence is in the present perfect tense, which is used to describe actions that started in the past and continue up to the present moment. ""A hundred men"" is a singular countable noun, so the verb ""surrounded"" is in the singular form.
"
0	" The correct sentence would be: ""They elected me."" The subject of the sentence is ""we,"" which is a plural pronoun, so the verb ""elected"" should be in the plural form ""elect."" Additionally, the pronoun ""me"" is in the objective case, which is used as the object of a verb or a preposition.
"
0	" The correct sentence would be: ""Which report did he submit that John was incompetent?"" The sentence is in the past tense, but the verb ""did"" should agree with the subject ""he"" in the past tense. Additionally, the phrase ""that John was incompetent"" should be in the relative clause form, with ""that"" introducing the relative clause and ""was incompetent"" being the predicate.
"

"
0	" The grammar mistake in the sentence is the lack of a comma between ""let"" and ""the cats."" The correct sentence would be: ""He let the cats, which were whining, out.""

"
0	" The grammar mistake in the sentence is that it is not clear who made the claim. The correct sentence would be: ""A proof that the claim had been made was given that John had lied."" Additionally, the phrase ""had been made"" could be replaced with ""had been made by John"" to clarify who made the claim. The corrected sentence would be: ""A proof that the claim made by John had been made was given that John had lied.""
"
0	" The grammar mistake in the sentence is that it is not clear who did the attributing. The sentence should be written in a different way to clarify this. For example, ""It was determined that a short circuit caused by an overloaded transducer was the cause of the fire that destroyed most of my factory. He attributed the fire to this cause."" Additionally, the phrase ""which was caused by an overloaded transducer"" could be replaced with ""which was caused by an overloaded transducer"" to make the sentence more clear. The corrected sentence would be: ""He attributed the fire, which was caused by an overloaded transducer, to this cause.""
"
1	" None
"
0	" The grammar mistake in the sentence is the incorrect use of the word ""left."" The correct sentence would be: ""I want that Bill's departure remains a secret."" The word ""remains"" is used instead of ""remain"" to show that the action of keeping it a secret is ongoing. Additionally, ""Bill's departure"" is used instead of ""Bill left"" to indicate that Bill is leaving rather than the fact of him leaving being a secret.
"
0	" The grammar mistake in the sentence is the incorrect use of the word ""drives."" The sentence should be written in a different way to make it grammatically correct. For example, ""I know a man, and Tom drives him as well."" The word ""and"" is used to connect the two clauses, and ""as well"" is used to indicate that Tom drives the man in addition to doing something else. Alternatively, the sentence could be written as ""I know a man whom Tom drives,"" which is also grammatically correct.
"
0	" The grammar mistake in the sentence is the lack of a comma between ""Drowning cats"" and ""which is against the law."" The correct sentence would be: ""Drowning cats, which is against the law, are hard to rescue."" The use of the comma in this sentence helps to separate two clauses and makes the sentence easier to read. The clause ""which is against the law"" is a nonessential clause, meaning it provides additional information that is not necessary to the sentence's main meaning, and it is set off by the comma.
"
0	" The grammar mistake in the sentence is the incorrect use of ""than."" The correct sentence would be: ""Muriel said nothing other than that she had been insulted."" The word ""other"" is used instead of ""than"" to compare two things. In this case, ""nothing other"" is used to indicate that Muriel said something else other than the fact that she had been insulted. Additionally, the word ""than"" is often used to show a comparison between two clauses, but in this case, there is no comparison being made. The corrected sentence would be: ""Muriel said nothing other than that she had been insulted.""
"
0	" The grammar mistake in the sentence is the lack of a comma between ""Himself"" and ""is."" The correct sentence would be: ""Himself is understood by Rutherford."" The use of a comma in this sentence helps to separate the subject ""Himself"" from the verb ""is."" The corrected sentence would be: ""Himself is understood by Rutherford."" The word ""himself"" is a reflexive pronoun that refers back to the subject ""Rutherford."" The sentence means that Rutherford understands himself, which is a grammatically correct sentence.
"
1	" There are no mistakes in the sentence.
"
1	" The grammar mistake in your sentence is that it is missing a verb. The sentence is incomplete and lacks a main verb to convey a complete thought. To make the sentence grammatically correct, you can add a verb such as ""is"" to make it ""The proof that this set is recursive is difficult."" This sentence conveys a complete thought and is grammatically correct.
"
0	" The grammar mistakes in your sentence are: The lack of a verb after ""plays the lute"" and ""sings"" to complete the thoughts. The adjective ""lousy"" is not correctly paired with a noun to modify.
"
0	" The grammar mistake in your sentence is that the subject of the sentence (Suzie) is not agreeing with the verb ""will prepare."" The verb should be in the third person singular form to agree with the subject.
"
0	" The grammar mistakes in your sentence are: The lack of a verb after ""went"" to complete the thought. The use of the pronoun ""who"" instead of ""what"" to refer to the object eaten.
"
0	" The grammar mistakes in your sentence are: The lack of a verb after ""we elect"" to complete the thought. The lack of a clear subject and verb agreement. The use of the possessive pronoun ""boy's"" instead of a plural form of ""boy"" The use of the plural form of ""guardian"" instead of ""guardian's""
"
0	" The grammar mistake in your sentence is that ""sane"" is not an adjective that can be used to describe a person. ""Sane"" is a verb, meaning ""to be in a sound state of mind.""
"
0	" The grammar mistakes in your sentence are: The lack of a verb after ""crosses"" to complete the thought. The use of the same preposition ""crosses"" twice in the same sentence to indicate the same action.
"
0	" The grammar mistakes in your sentence are: The lack of a verb after ""crosses"" to complete the thought. The use of the pronoun ""it"" to refer to the place, but the place was previously described as ""the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River,"" so it should be ""the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River.""
"
0	" The correct sentence would be: ""Who is she trying to make up to now?"" The mistake is that you wrote ""make up to"" instead of ""make up with."" ""Make up with"" means to reconcile with someone after a disagreement or conflict. ""Make up to"" means to exaggerate or lie about something to make it seem more impressive.
"
1	" ""Wind was gotten of a plot"" - This sentence is incomplete. It should be ""The wind was gotten off the plot"" or ""The wind was blowing off the plot."" ""to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam"" - This phrase is grammatically correct, but it doesn't make sense in the context of the sentence. It seems like it belongs in a different sentence. ""to negotiate an honorable end"" - This phrase is also grammatically correct, but it doesn't have any context in the sentence. It seems like it belongs in a different sentence. None of the mistakes are serious, but they make the sentence difficult to understand.

0	" The use of the pronoun ""she"" is incorrect. The sentence doesn't provide any context about the gender of the person that Mike referred to, so ""she"" should be replaced with ""they"" or ""the person"". The verb ""quip"" is not used in the correct way. ""Quip"" means to make a clever or witty remark, but in the sentence, it seems like ""quip"" is being used as a synonym for ""wear"". A better way to phrase the sentence would be ""Which hat did Mike say that the person never wore?"" or ""Which hat did Mike joke that the person never wore?"". Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: ""Which hat did Mike say that the person never wore?"" or ""Which hat did Mike joke that the person never wore?"".
"
0	" The use of the word ""girl"" is incorrect. The sentence doesn't provide any context about the age or gender of the person that Mike referred to, so ""girl"" should be replaced with a more neutral term like ""person"" or ""they"". The verb ""quip"" is not used in the correct way. ""Quip"" means to make a clever or witty remark, but in the sentence, it seems like ""quip"" is being used to indicate that the person never wore the hat. A better way to phrase the sentence would be ""Which person did Mike say never wore this hat?"" or ""Which person did Mike joke never wore this hat?"".

0	" The grammar mistake in your sentence is that you have used the word ""convicts"" which refers to people who have been convicted of a crime and are serving a sentence in prison. However, in the context of your sentence, it seems like you are talking about building cages for animals. So, you should use the word ""animal"" or ""wildlife"" instead of ""convicts"".

Here are a few examples: Janet broke Bill's finger on the finger. Janet broke Bill's fingers on the finger. Janet broke Bill's finger, which was on the finger. Note: The sentence ""Janet broke Bill on the finger"" can also be interpreted as meaning that Janet broke a piece of furniture named ""Bill"" that was located on the finger.

The correct sentence should be: ""The book of poems from Blackwell's takes a very long time to read.""

"
0	" The grammar mistake in your sentence is that the verb ""kick"" is in the wrong form. The verb should be in the second person singular form, which would be ""kick you"" or ""kick you!"", depending on the intended tone of the sentence. Corrected sentence: Kick you! (implying a command or request to the person being addressed to perform the action of kicking) or Corrected sentence: You kick someone. (implying that the person being addressed is capable of kicking someone else)'

"
0	" The grammar mistake in your sentence is that it is not clear what the subject of the sentence is. The subject is not explicitly stated, but it appears to be ""you"". Additionally, the sentence is missing a verb for the subject. Corrected sentence: You got an accurate description of someone/something. (implying that the person being addressed received a description of someone or something that is accurate) or Corrected sentence: Who did you get an accurate description of? (implying that the speaker is asking who the person being addressed got an accurate description of)
"
0	" The grammar mistakes in your sentence are: The sentence is missing an article before ""Peter"" (e.g. ""The Peter we all like"" instead of ""Peter we all like""). The verb ""was"" is in the past tense and should be in the present tense to describe an ongoing state (e.g. ""The Peter we all like is at the party"" instead of ""The Peter we all like was at the party"").
"
0	" The grammar mistake in your sentence is that ""imposition"" is a noun and not a verb, so it should not be in the form of ""imposition of"" as it is implying an action. The correct way to say it would be ""The imposition of a fine by the government"" or ""The government's imposition of a fine""
"
1	" None
"
0	" The grammar mistake in your sentence is the use of the word ""I"" after ""man"" because it implies a first person point of view, but the sentence is written in a third person point of view. The correct way to say it would be ""You wanted to meet the man whom I saw."" or ""You wanted to meet the man I saw.""
"
0	" The grammar mistake in your sentence is that the verb ""demonized"" is not in the correct tense. The correct verb tense for the sentence would be ""Anson demonized David every day"" (present simple tense) or ""Anson demonized David every day"" (present continuous tense) to imply an ongoing action.
"
0	" The grammar mistakes in your sentence are: The verb ""is"" should be in the present tense, the correct form would be ""There is a programme about Euripides on Radio 4 tonight?"" You should use ""on"" instead of ""a"" before ""Radio 4"" because ""Radio 4"" is a specific radio station and not a general radio. You should use ""tonight"" instead of ""tonight?"" as it is a statement and not a question.

0	" The grammar mistakes in your sentence are: The use of the word ""extremely"" before ""frantically"" is unnecessary and the two adverbs can be combined. ""Anson danced at Trade"" is missing an object, it is not clear what Anson is dancing at. The use of ""at Trade"" is unclear as it is not clear what ""Trade"" refers to.
"
0	" The grammar mistake in your sentence is that the sentence is not clear, it is not clear what you are asking. You should consider rephrasing the sentence to make the question more clear and grammatically correct. The correct sentence would be ""What did you ask Medea for?"" or ""Who did Medea give (something) to?""

"
0	" The grammar mistakes in your sentence are: The subject of the sentence is ""Medea"" but the verb ""tried"" is in the third person singular form ""tries"" which does not match the subject. The object of the verb ""tried"" should be ""the nurse to poison her children"" but it is not clear who the nurse is or what the children are. The phrase ""to poison her children"" is not grammatically correct, it should be ""to poison her children with"" or ""to poison her children by""
"
0	" The grammar mistake in your sentence is that the verb ""know"" is in the present tense but the rest of the sentence is in the past tense. The correct sentence would be ""I felt that I knew you"" or ""I felt that I had known you""
"
0	" The grammar mistakes in your sentence are: The use of ""will"" implies future tense but the meaning of the sentence is unclear as it is not clear what ""it"" refers to. The use of ""can"" implies possibility but the meaning of the sentence is unclear as it is not clear what ""it"" refers to. You should use ""he's able to"" instead of ""he can"" as ""can"" is a modal verb that is used to express ability and the sentence is asking about ability. The correct sentence would be ""Will he be able to do it?""

0	" There is a grammar mistake in the sentence. The verb ""having fought"" is in the present perfect progressive tense, which is used to describe an ongoing action that started in the past and continues to the present. However, the sentence also includes the past tense verb ""dragon,"" which creates a contradiction. To correct the sentence, you can use the simple past tense to describe a completed action, like this: Gilgamesh fought the dragon. Or, you can use the present perfect tense to describe an ongoing action that started in the past and is still happening, like this: Gilgamesh has been fighting the dragon.

"
0	" There are two grammar mistakes in the sentence: The use of ""which"" twice in the same sentence is redundant and unnecessary. Instead, we should use ""that"" to introduce the first noun, and ""which"" for the second one: + Which king did you ask that invaded which city? The use of ""did"" is incorrect. Instead, we should use the past tense of the helping verb ""do"" to match with the past participle ""invaded"": + Which king did you ask that invaded which city?

0	" There are two grammar mistakes in the sentence: ""That banana is eating the monkey"" - This sentence is not grammatically correct because it is not possible for an inanimate object like a banana to eat something. The correct sentence would be ""The monkey is eating the banana"" or ""The banana is being eaten by the monkey."" ""the monkey"" - It is not clear what the subject of the sentence is. The sentence would be improved by specifying the subject, such as ""The monkey is eating the banana that it stole from the fruit stand.""
