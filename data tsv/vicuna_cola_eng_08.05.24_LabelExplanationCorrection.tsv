"
0	" The grammar mistake is that the sentence is not grammatically correct in Standard English. The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys that as you eat less food, you feel hungrier and want more food. ""Eat less"" is the present tense form of the verb ""eat"" in the if-clause, and ""Want more"" is the result in the then-clause. The word ""less"" is used to compare two amounts of food and convey that as you eat less, you feel hungrier and want more. In Standard English, the typical order for a conditional sentence is: ""If + subject + present tense verb in the if-clause, then + subject + past tense verb in the then-clause"". "	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""As you eat less, you want more.""
"

0	" There are two grammar mistakes in your sentence: The verb ""demand"" should be in the present tense, not the present perfect tense. The correct form is ""demand"" instead of ""demanded"". The sentence is missing an auxiliary verb to form the conditional sentence correctly. The correct form should be ""The more John eats, the more he pays"" or ""The more John eats, the more he will pay"". "	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""I demand that the more John eats, the more he pays."" (Note that ""demand"" should be in the present tense and the sentence should use the present tense form of the verb ""eat"" and the appropriate conditional construction to express the conditional meaning.)
"
0	" There are two grammar mistakes in your sentence: The verb ""listens"" should be in the present tense, not the present perfect tense. The correct form is ""listens"" instead of ""listened"". The sentence is missing a comma to separate the independent clause from the dependent clause. The correct form should be ""Mary listens to the Grateful Dead, she gets depressed"" or ""Mary listens to the Grateful Dead. She gets depressed."" "	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""Mary listens to the Grateful Dead. She gets depressed."" (Note that ""listens"" should be in the present tense and a comma should be used to separate the independent and dependent clauses.)
"

"
0	" There is a grammar mistake in your sentence: The word ""stakes"" is an uncountable noun, which means it should not be used with the indefinite article ""a/an"". The correct form should be ""The higher the stakes, the lower his expectations are"" or ""The higher the stakes are, the lower his expectations are"". "	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""The higher the stakes are, the lower his expectations are."" (Note that ""stakes"" should not be preceded by an indefinite article and the verb tense of the second clause should be consistent with the first clause.)
"
0	" There are two grammar mistakes in your sentence: The verb ""is"" should be in the present tense, not the present continuous tense. The correct form is ""is"" instead of ""is being"". The sentence is missing an auxiliary verb to form the negative sentence correctly. The correct form should be ""The more Fred is obnoxious, the less attention you should pay to him"" or ""The more Fred is obnoxious, the less attention you shouldn't pay to him"". "	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""The more Fred is obnoxious, the less attention you shouldn't pay to him."" (Note that ""is"" should be in the present tense and the sentence should use the appropriate negative construction to express the negative meaning.)
"
0	" There is a grammar mistake in your sentence: The word ""lots"" should be followed by a noun or a pronoun to complete the comparison. The correct form should be ""John was much more obnoxious than Fred"" or ""John was a lot more obnoxious than Fred"". "	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""John was much more obnoxious than Fred."" (Note that ""lots"" should be followed by a noun or pronoun to complete the comparison and ""more"" should be used instead of ""much"" to compare the degree of obnoxiousness.)
"
0	" There are two grammar mistakes in your sentence: The verb ""get"" should be in the third person singular form ""gets"" to match with the subject ""people"". The correct form is ""gets"" instead of ""get"". The sentence is missing an auxiliary verb to form the passive voice correctly. The correct form should be ""The more people you give beer to, the more people get sick"" or ""The more people you give beer to, the more they get sick"". "	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""The more people you give beer to, the more they get sick.""

"
0	" The grammar mistake in the sentence is that the verb tense is inconsistent. The past participle ""been"" suggests a past continuous tense, but the negative ""can not"" suggests a present simple negative tense. "	" The correct version of the sentence would be: ""He cannot have been working"" or ""He can't have been working."" The first sentence uses the contraction ""can't"" and the past participle ""been"" to create a negative past continuous tense, while the second sentence uses the contraction ""can't"" and the past participle ""been"" to create a negative present perfect tense.

0	" The grammar mistake in the sentence is that the phrase ""from the tree"" is not placed correctly. The correct prepositional phrase would be ""from the ball."" "	" The correct version of the sentence would be: ""The box contained the ball from the ball"" or ""The box contained the ball that was in the tree."" The first sentence uses the preposition ""from"" to indicate that the ball was contained in the box and that it originated from the ball, while the second sentence uses the phrase ""that was in the tree"" to indicate that the ball was in the tree before it was contained in the box.
"
0	" The grammar mistake in the sentence is that the verb ""escaped"" is in the wrong tense. The correct verb tense should be ""escape"" in the past tense to match the past tense of the adjective ""gas."" "	" The correct version of the sentence would be: ""The tube was escaped by the gas"" or ""The tube escaped by the gas."" The first sentence uses the verb ""escaped"" in the past tense to indicate that the tube was able to escape from the gas, while the second sentence uses the phrasal verb ""escape by"" to indicate that the tube was able to escape from the gas.
"
1	 None. 	" The sentence is already grammatically correct. There are no strict grammar mistakes in the sentence.
"
0	" The grammar mistake in the sentence is that the article ""the"" is not necessary. "	" The correct version of the sentence would be ""The tub leaked water"" or ""A tub leaked water.""

"
0	" The grammar mistake is that ""fill it"" is a phrasal verb, and it should be in its base form ""fill"" when used as the object of the verb ""did."" The correct form of the sentence is: ""What the water did to the whole bottle was to fill it."" "	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""What the water did to the whole bottle was to fill it.""
"
0	" The grammar mistake is that ""free"" is an adjective and it should be in its base form ""free"" when used as the object of the verb ""leaked.""

"
0	" The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. In the original sentence, the verb ""perceives"" should agree with the subject ""problem"" in number.

"
1	 None. 	" The sentence is grammatically correct: ""A hundred men surrounded the fort.""
"
0	" The pronoun usage is incorrect.In the original sentence, the pronoun ""me"" is incorrect. The correct pronoun to use in this context is ""us.""

"	" ""He attributed the fire, which destroyed most of my factory, to a short circuit caused by an overloaded transducer.""
"
0	" The sentence is grammatically correct, but it could be rephrased for clarity and readability.

"	" ""The mayor regarded the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith as absurd.""
"
0	" In the original sentence, the word order is incorrect. The phrase ""to remain a secret"" should come after the verb ""leave."" Additionally, the verb tense should be consistent throughout the sentence. "	" The correct sentence would be ""I want Bill to leave to remain a secret."" Note that in this context, the word ""remain"" is used in the sense of keeping something hidden or secret, so it would be more appropriate to use the phrase ""leave to remain a secret"" instead of ""leave as a secret"" or ""leave to be a secret"" ""I want Bill to leave to remain a secret.""

"
0	" The first grammar mistake is the use of the comma before the conjunction ""which"". In this case, the comma is not necessary and should be removed.

"	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""The proof of this set is recursive and difficult.""
"
0	" The grammar mistake in your sentence is that the subject of the sentence should be ""Henry"" instead of ""The madrigals which Henry plays."" Additionally, ""plays the lute and sings"" should be in the form of a participle phrase to function as an adjective to describe ""madrigals."" "	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""Henry's madrigals, when he plays the lute and sings, sound lousy.""
"
0	" The grammar mistakes in your sentence are that ""I"" should be replaced with ""he"" or ""she"" to agree with the subject ""Tom,"" and ""prepare"" should be replaced with ""prepare these grapes"" to complete the infinitive phrase. "	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""Tom picked these grapes, and Suzie will prepare them.""
"
0	" The grammar mistake in your sentence is that it should be ""Who ate what?"" instead of ""who ate what?"" because ""who"" is a relative pronoun that requires a singular verb, and ""ate"" is in the past tense. Additionally, ""go"" should be changed to ""did"" to agree with the past tense of ""ate."" "	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""Where did you go, and who ate what?""
"
0	" The grammar mistakes in your sentence are that ""did"" should be replaced with ""has"" to agree with the plural subject ""we,"" and ""guardian's employer president"" should be replaced with ""the guardian's employer president"" to use the correct preposition.

"
1	 None. 	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""How sane is Peter?""
"
0	" The grammar mistake in your sentence is that ""too"" should not be used in this context. ""Too"" is an adverb used to mean ""also"" or ""excessively,"" but in this case, it doesn't make sense. Note that ""the place where Route 150 crosses the River"" is already specific enough to indicate the location, so repeating ""the place"" is redundant. "	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the River, and my dad lives at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River.""
"
0	" The grammar mistake in your sentence is that ""it"" is ambiguous and unclear. ""It"" could refer to the location where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River, but it could also refer to something else. To avoid ambiguity, you should use a clear and specific noun instead of ""it."" By replacing ""it"" with ""there,"" the sentence is clear and unambiguous, and it means that your dad lives in the same place where you live, which is the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River. "	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River, and my dad lives there too.""

"
0	" The grammar mistake in your sentence is that ""gotten"" is not a correct past participle form of the verb ""get."" The correct form is ""got.""

"
0	" The grammar mistake is that the pronoun ""she"" does not agree with the antecedent ""Mike"" in gender. The correct pronoun to use would be ""he"" or ""they"" depending on the gender identity of Mike. "	" The correct version of the sentence would be: ""Which hat did Mike quip that he never wore?"" or ""Which hat did Mike quip that they never wore?"" (if Mike's gender identity is non-binary or unknown).
"
0	" The grammar mistake is that the pronoun ""this"" is not necessary and is not grammatically correct in this context. The correct way to phrase the sentence would be to simply use ""never wore"" after ""did Mike quip"" without the word ""this"". "	" The correct version of the sentence would be: ""Which girl did Mike quip never wore this hat?""
"
0	" The grammar mistake is that ""convicts"" is an uncountable noun, so it should not be preceded by the indefinite article ""a"" or ""an"". Additionally, the word ""cages"" should be pluralized to match the plural subject ""convicts"". "	" The correct version of the sentence would be: ""We donated wire for the convicts to build cages with.""

0	" The grammar mistake is that the verb ""have"" is in the wrong tense. The correct tense for the verb ""have"" in this sentence would be the present tense, indicating a statement about the present. "	" The correct version of the sentence would be: ""I don't have any money.""
"
1	 None. 	" The correct version of the sentence is: ""Do you believe the claim that somebody was looking for something?""
"

"
0	" The sentence has a few grammar mistakes. In the original sentence, ""did so"" is not a correct way to form the past participle of the verb ""do"".

Also, ""did"" is not a linking verb, it is used to help form the past tense of other verbs, in this case, ""were doing"" is the correct form of the present participle of the verb ""do"" which is used as the main verb in the sentence, it is used to indicate the action being done by the subject ""you"" while the subject ""Bill"" is being seen by the speaker. You can see this construction, ""was/were + verb-ing"" in many sentences such as ""I was playing when he called."" or ""She was cooking dinner while I was studying."" "	" The correct version of the sentence would be ""I saw Bill while you were doing so Mary.""
"
0	" The sentence has a few grammar mistakes. In the original sentence, ""did"" is not a linking verb, it is used to help form the past tense of other verbs.

"
0	" The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the phrase ""demonized up"" is not a grammatically correct phrase. ""Demonize"" is a verb that means to portray someone or something as evil or morally corrupt, so it doesn't make sense to use it in this context. The phrase ""up the Khyber"" is also not clear in meaning, as the Khyber is a region in Asia and it's not clear what ""up"" means in this context. "	" The correct version of the sentence would be: ""Anson demonized the Khyber,"" or ""Anson portrayed the Khyber as evil.""

However, there is a small punctuation mistake.

Therefore, the correct form of the sentence should be ""The monkey ate the banana."" "	" The correct version of the sentence would be: ""The monkey ate the banana.""
"
0	" The sentence has two grammar mistakes: the use of ""could"" and the lack of a verb after ""like"". In your sentence, there are two grammar mistakes. First, the use of ""could"" is incorrect.
