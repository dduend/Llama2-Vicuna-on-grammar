      Explanation: Your original sentence ""I remembered having kissed Mary"" is grammatically correct, but it could be improved by using a more active and direct verb tense. Instead of ""having kissed,"" you could simply use the past simple form of the verb ""kiss.""

The subject-verb agreement is incorrect (What did you ask who Medea gave? should be What did you ask whom Medee gave?), and the word order is also wrong (the adjective ""who"" should come before the noun it modifies).

    "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Medea tried to poison her children through the nurse.
      Explanation: Your original sentence contains a common error known as ""misplaced modifier."" The phrase ""to poison her children"" should be placed directly after the subject ""Medea,"" not after the verb ""tried."" Additionally, it would be more idiomatic to say ""through the nurse"" instead of ""the nurse"" to indicate that the nurse was an intermediary in the act of poisoning.

      Explanation:
       Your sentence contains a common idiomatic expression, which is grammatically correct. However, it's worth noting that ""liked myself"" is not a standard phrase in English and may sound awkward to native speakers. The word order of the sentence is also slightly unusual, as we typically expect the subject (I) to come before the verb (thought).
      Additionally, if you want to make your sentence more concise and natural-sounding, you could replace ""liked
