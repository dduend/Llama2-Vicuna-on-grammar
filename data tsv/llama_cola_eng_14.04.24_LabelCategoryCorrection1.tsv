      (Note: I changed ""loose"" to ""free"" because ""loose"" doesn't fit grammatically in this context.)
"
0	syntax	". Here's the corrected sentence: If you had eaten more, you would have wanted less.
    4. There are two mistakes in your original sentence:
        - ""would want"" should be ""would have wanted"" (tense agreement)
        - ""more"" is not needed before ""less"" (redundant phrase)
"

"
0	syntax	". Here's the correct version of your sentence: ""The more John eats, the more he pays.""
      (Note: I changed ""eat"" to ""eats"" because ""John"" is a third-person singular subject and requires the verb form ""eats"" instead of ""eat"".)
"
1	none	". The correct version of the sentence is: Mary listens to the Grateful Dead and gets depressed.
      Note: I changed ""she"" to ""and"" because the subject of the sentence is a single entity (""Mary""), so it should be in the singular form. Additionally, I added a comma after ""Grateful Dead"" for clarity and proper punctuation.
"

"
0	syntax	". Here's the corrected sentence: The more pictures of him that appear in the news make John become embarrassed.
      (Note: I changed ""appear"" to ""make"" because ""appear"" is a linking verb and doesn't fit well with the subject-verb agreement.)
"
0	syntax	". Here's the corrected sentence: Every senator seems to become more corrupt as they talk to more lobbyists.
      (Note: I changed ""he"" to ""they"" to make the sentence gender-neutral and fixed the verb tense agreement issue.)

"
0	syntax	". The correct version of the sentence should be: Mickey looked up at it.
    4. Here's why: In English, when we use a verb like ""looked,"" we need to specify what the subject is looking at. In your original sentence, ""it"" is not clear what Mickey is looking at, so adding ""at"" makes the sentence more specific and grammatically correct.
    5. Additionally, you might want to consider using an article before ""it"" (e.g., ""the it"") if you intend for ""it"" to refer to a specific

"

"
1	none	". The sentence ""John is eager"" is already grammatically correct and does not require any changes. However, if you'd like to rephrase it for clarity or emphasis, here are some suggestions:
        - John shows eagerness. (emphasizes the quality of being eager)
        - John feels eager. (adds a sense of emotion to the sentence)
        - John is very eager. (intensifies the degree of eagerness)

"
0	syntax	". The correct version of the sentence should be: Mary intended John to go abroad for/to study/work/travel etc. (depending on the purpose of going abroad).
    "
0	syntax	". The correct version of the sentence should be ""I remembered kissing Mary."" instead of ""I remembered having kissed Mary"". In this case, the verb tense is not consistent, and the past perfect tense is not necessary.

        - The word order in the second clause should be reversed to make it grammatically correct.
"

"
1	none	". Your original sentence is grammatically correct and conveys your intended meaning effectively. However, if you'd like to make it a bit more concise, you could rephrase it as: ""I'm sure I would prefer him eating fruit over cookies."" This version uses the verb ""prefer"" instead of ""like,"" which is more idiomatic in this context.

"

    "
0	syntax	". Here is the correct version of the sentence: Which hat did Mike say that she never wore?
    4. (Optional) Here's an explanation of the correction: In the original sentence, ""quip"" is a verb meaning to make a clever or witty remark, but it doesn't fit well in this context. Instead, I suggested using the phrase ""say"" which better conveys the intended meaning. Additionally, I changed ""she never wore"" to ""she never wore"" to make the sentence more concise and natural-sounding.
"
0	syntax	". Here is the corrected sentence: Which girl did Mike never quip wear this hat?
    4. There are two mistakes in your original sentence: ""quip"" should be ""quiped"", and ""never wore"" should be ""never wear"".

"
0	syntax	". Here's the corrected sentence: I won't ask you to believe that he tried forcing me to give her any money. (I changed ""to force"" to ""forcing"" because ""force"" is a verb, and it needs an -ing form after it.)

    "

"
1	none	". The correct version of your sentence is: It is easy to play sonatas on this violin.
Note that the word ""sonatas"" should be in the plural form because it refers to multiple pieces of music, not just one piece.
"
1	none	". The correct version of the sentence is: This violin is difficult to play sonatas on it.
      (Note: ""on"" is a preposition that requires an object, so ""it"" is added after ""sonatas"" to make the phrase grammatically complete.)

```
"
0	syntax	". The correct version of the sentence should be ""Sandra beamed a warm welcome."" Instead of using ""beamed,"" which is not a verb, you could use ""greeted"" or ""welcomed."" Additionally, ""cheerful"" does not fit well in this context and can be removed to make the sentence more concise.
    "
0	syntax	". The correct version of the sentence should be ""You have really lived it up."" Instead of ""You've"" which is a contraction of ""you have"", use ""have"" as the verb form to make the sentence grammatically correct.

    4. Here's why: In English, we use prepositions like ""to"" or ""on"" to indicate the object of an action. In your original sentence, ""at"" is not a preposition and doesn't make sense in this context. Additionally, the verb tense is inconsistent - ""buttered"" should be changed to ""buttering"" to match the present participle form of the main verb ""toast"".

"
1	none	". Your sentence is grammatically correct and does not require any changes. However, if you'd like to improve it, you could consider adding a comma after ""Ellen"" for clarity: Ellen warned Helen against skating on thin ice, but this is purely stylistic and not essential for the meaning of the sentence.
"
0	syntax	". Here is the correct version of the sentence: Cynthia nibbled on the carrot stick. (Added ""stick"" to make the sentence grammatically correct.)
"

    "
0	syntax	". The correct version of the sentence should be ""Paul laughed at Mary's joke"" instead of ""Paul laughed at Mary"".
    4. Here's why: In English, when we use a verb like ""laughed"", it typically takes an object that indicates what was being laughed at. In your original sentence, there is no such indication, which makes the sentence incomplete and grammatically incorrect. By adding ""Mary's joke"" as the object of the verb ""laughed"", we can make the sentence complete and grammatically correct.

However, if you'd like to make it more concise, you could rephrase it as ""Benny worked at a shoe factory while he was a student."" This version uses the phrase ""while he was"" instead of ""when he was,"" which is a bit more idiomatic and concise.

"

"

"

"
0	syntax	". Here is the corrected version of your sentence: John put the book into the box.
      (Note: I changed ""in"" to ""into"" because ""into"" is more appropriate for placing an object inside a container.)
"
0	syntax	". Here is the corrected version of your sentence: John taught English syntax to new students.
    4. (Optional) Explanation of the correction: In the original sentence, ""English Syntax"" should be written as a single unit, with no space between the words. Additionally, ""taught"" should be in the present tense to match the context of the sentence.
"

"
0	syntax	". The correct version of the sentence should be ""John paid me for the book.""
    4. Here's why: In English, when we use the phrase ""paid against,"" it typically implies that the payment was made in exchange for something else, rather than being a direct payment for an item. To make your sentence grammatically correct, you should change ""against"" to ""for."" Additionally, the word order of the sentence is slightly off - it's more common to say ""John paid me for the book"" instead of ""John paid me the book.""

For example, instead of ""threw,"" you could use the more formal and precise verb ""discarded"" or ""recycled.""

Here's an updated version: After reading the pamphlet, Judy discarded it into the garbage can, or After reading the pamphlet, Judy recycled it into the garbage can

      (Note: I changed ""seems"" to ""is"" and added ""for hiding"" to make the sentence grammatically correct.)
"
1	none	". Here's the corrected sentence for clarity purposes only: There are believed to be sheep in the park.
Note that ""There is"" should be changed to ""There are"" because ""sheep"" is a plural noun, and it sounds more natural to use the plural form of the verb ""to be"".
"
0	syntax	". The correct version of the sentence should be ""I hope to study in France."" (No need for ""would"" because it's not necessary and it changes the meaning of the sentence)

    "
0	syntax	". Here's the corrected sentence: As a statesman, he could hardly do anything worth mentioning.

    "
0	syntax	". Here's the correct version of the sentence: Blue leather shows Betsy to be pretty.
      (Note: I changed ""shows herself"" to ""shows"" and added a preposition ""to be"" after ""pretty"" to make the sentence grammatically correct.)
"
0	syntax	". The correct version of the sentence should be ""Gwen hit the ball"" instead of ""Gwen hit the baseball."" This is because ""baseball"" is a noun, and it cannot be used as an object directly in a sentence like this. It needs to be modified with a preposition such as ""with"" or ""on"" to make it grammatically correct.
    "
0	syntax	". The correct version of the sentence should be: I hit you because you knew the answer.
    4. Here's why: In this sentence ""I hit that"" is incorrect and it should be replaced with a more appropriate verb such as ""hit"". Also, ""you knew the answer"" needs to be rephrased to make it clear who knew what. The corrected version of the sentence addresses both issues.
"

"
0	syntax	". Here's the corrected sentence: ""The one with the red cover takes a very long time to read."" (Note that I changed ""a"" to ""the"" before ""red cover"" because ""a"" is used for indefinite noun phrases, and ""the"" is used for definite noun phrases.)

0	syntax	". Here's the corrected version of your sentence: There were four men who arrived at the station when I pulled up.

Note: In this example, the original sentence contains a grammatical error in the verb tense consistency. The past simple form ""arrived"" is used for all the men, but the present participle form ""pulling up"" is used for the speaker. To correct this mistake, we need to change the verb tense of the sentence to ensure consistency throughout the sentence.

"
0	syntax	". The correct version of the sentence should be ""Kim and Terry are happy."" Instead of ""is"" (which is a third-person singular present tense verb), we need to use ""are"" (which is a plural form of the verb ""to be"") because both Kim and Terry are subjects in the sentence.
    "

    "

However, if you'd like to make it more formal or precise, here's a slight modification that could help: Smith lent a valuable collection of manuscripts to the library. This version uses the verb ""lend"" instead of ""loaned,"" which is more commonly used in formal writing and might sound more appropriate for your context.
    "

"
0	syntax	". The correct version of the sentence should be ""The soup thickens as it cooks.""
"
1	syntax	". Correct version of the sentence: I gave money to charity.
      Explanation: In your original sentence, there should be an article ""the"" before ""charity"". Also, it's more common to use the singular form of the verb ""gave"" when referring to a single act of giving. So, the corrected version is ""I gave money to charity.""
"
0	syntax	". The correct version of the sentence should be ""John asked."" instead of ""John asked."" (period at the end of the sentence).
    "
0	syntax	". The correct version of the sentence should be ""I saw even the student."" (no comma after ""even"").
"
0	syntax	". The correct version of the sentence should be ""John whispered that Mary had left.""
    4. Here's why: In English, when we use the verb ""whisper"" followed by an infinitive phrase starting with ""to,"" we need to use the auxiliary verb ""had"" instead of just ""left"" because it is in the past perfect tense. This helps maintain proper sentence structure and avoid confusion about the timing of the actions.
    5. Additionally, I suggest you replace ""Mary left"" with ""Mary had left"" to make the sentence more

"

      (Note: I changed ""boys"" to ""boy"" because each boy should be fighting with individual other boys, not a group of other boys.)
"
0	syntax	". The correct version of the sentence should be ""John's mother likes him."" instead of ""John's mother likes himself"". In this case, the word ""himself"" is not needed as it is already implied by the subject-verb agreement.

    "
1	none	". The correct version of the sentence is: John is proud of Mary.
"
0	syntax	". The correct version of the sentence should be ""You should sit before you.""
    4. Here's why: In English, we use the word ""before"" to indicate that one action happens before another. In your original sentence, ""there"" doesn't make sense as a location for sitting. Instead, it would be more natural to say ""you should sit before you,"" indicating that you should sit down before doing anything else.
    5. Additionally, the word ""should"" is an auxiliary verb and needs a main verb to complete the sentence. In this case, we can
"
0	syntax	". The correct version of the sentence should be ""There are nurses available.""
      (Note: I changed ""is"" to ""are"" because ""nurse"" is a plural noun, and we use the plural form of verbs with plural nouns.)
