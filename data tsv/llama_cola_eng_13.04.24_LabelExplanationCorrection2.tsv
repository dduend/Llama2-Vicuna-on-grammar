1	". There is a slight lexical mistake that you could improve upon to make the sentence more natural and idiomatic. The phrase ""rode the breeze"" doesn't quite work as it sounds a bit awkward. Instead of using ""breeze,"" which can be a bit vague, consider replacing it with ""wind."" So, your sentence could become:

"
1	". There is a potential error with the verb tense consistency. The sentence uses ""wriggled"" which is past simple, but ""loose"" is an adjective and doesn't change form in different tenses. To fix this, you could use either ""wriggled free"" or ""loosened itself"".
    "	". Here is the correct version of your sentence: The mechanical doll loosened itself.
    "
1	". The word ""want"" is not necessary in the second part of the sentence. Here's why: if you had eaten more, you would already be satisfied and wouldn't want any more food. So, the sentence could be simplified as follows: If you had eaten more, you would have been full. "	". The correct version of your sentence is: If you had eaten more, you would have been full.
    "
1	". There is a potential issue with the word order and phrasing that could make the meaning less clear. Specifically...
    "	". Here is the correct version of the sentence: ""As you eat more, you want less."" This maintains the original meaning while using clearer wording and grammar.
    "
1	". There is a potential lexical mistake, as ""want"" and ""eat"" are not synonyms, so the phrase ""the more you would want"" may not be the best choice of words. However, it's still possible to understand what you mean.
    "	". Here's the correct version of your sentence: The more you would have wanted, the less you would eat. This version uses the past tense of ""want"" (i.e., ""had wanted"") to make the sentence grammatically correct and more idiomatic.
    "
1	". The word ""the"" before ""more John eat"" is redundant and can be omitted. Also, the phrase ""the more he pays"" could be rephrased as ""he pays more."" So, here's the corrected sentence: I demand that John eats more, the more he pays.
    "	". The correct version of the sentence is: I demand that John eat more, and he will pay more.

1	". The first error is the use of ""she gets depressed"" instead of ""it makes her depressed."" This change would make the sentence more idiomatic and accurate. Additionally, you might want to consider adding an article before ""Grateful Dead"" (e.g., ""the Grateful Dead"") for clarity.
    "	". Here's the corrected version: Mary listens to the Grateful Dead; it makes her depressed.

      - Instead of ""the higher the stakes,"" consider using ""as the stakes rise."" This phrase is more common and easier to understand.
      - Instead of ""the lower his expectations are,"" consider using ""his expectations decrease."" This wording better reflects the idea that as the stakes increase, his expectations decrease.
    "	". Here's the corrected sentence: As the stakes rise, his expectations decrease.

0	". The word ""obnoxious"" is used incorrectly here. It should be replaced with ""offensive"" or ""rude"". Obnoxious means something that is repulsive or disgusting, but in this context, it doesn't quite fit.

    "
1	". There is a potential issue with comparative form usage. ""lots more"" should be replaced with ""much more."" Here's the corrected version of your sentence: John was much more obnoxious than Fred.

1	". There is a slight lexical mistake - instead of ""get sick"", you could use the phrase ""get drunk"" to convey that more people will become intoxicated as they drink more beer. However, this is not a strict grammatical error, but rather a matter of word choice and context.

1	". There is a slight lexical mistake, as ""Marianne did not leave"" implies that Marianne was present at some point and then left, but there is no information about her being present before she didn't leave. To fix this, you could rephrase the sentence to make it more clear when Marianne stopped doing something or started not leaving. For example: ""Marianne did not stop leaving"" or ""Marianne did not start leaving"".

1	". There are no grammar mistakes in your sentence! Well done! However, if you want to make the sentence more concise and natural-sounding, you could replace ""He could not have been working"" with simply ""He wasn't working."" This is a common way to express the same idea using fewer words.
    "	". Sentence: He wasn't working.

1	". The only thing that could be improved is the use of the past perfect tense instead of ""can not have been working"". Instead, you could say ""He had not been working"" or ""He hadn't been working"" to convey the same meaning.

0	". The verb ""will believe"" should be changed to ""will be believed"". This is because the subject of the sentence is ""You"", and ""you"" is a pronoun that requires an infinitive form of the verb after it (e.g., ""you will go"", ""you will eat"").

    "
1	". There is a possible error with verb tense consistency, as ""There tended to be"" could imply past habitual action, but the phrase ""a lot of discussion"" suggests ongoing or current activity. To fix this, you might consider using the present simple instead of ""tended to be."" Here's the corrected sentence: There is a lot of discussion. "	". The correct version of your sentence is: There is a lot of discussion.

"
1	". There is a minor lexical mistake. The phrase ""to be"" is usually used as an auxiliary verb to form the progressive tenses (e.g., ""John is trying...""). In this case, it sounds like you are using ""try"" as a main verb, which can also work in some contexts, but it might sound more natural to use ""is trying.""
    "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: John is trying to be a good boy.

To be more specific, you might want to consider using the phrase ""We want John to succeed."" This conveys the idea of wanting John to achieve his goals or aspirations more clearly.
    "	". Here's the sentence with my suggestion incorporated: We want John to succeed.
    "
1	". There is one potential issue with the word order, as ""from the tree"" could be interpreted as a prepositional phrase modifying ""contained,"" rather than describing the source of the ball. To avoid this confusion, you might consider rephrasing the sentence to make it clear that ""from the tree"" modifies ""ball.""
    "	". Here is the correct version of your sentence: The box contained the ball that came from the tree.
    "
1	". The main mistake is that ""escaped"" should be ""escaping"". Additionally, you need to change ""tube"" to ""pipe"", as it is the correct term for the underground transportation system in London. Finally, instead of using ""by gas"", which doesn't make sense semantically, you could use ""with gas"" or simply ""using gas"".
    "	". Here's the corrected sentence: The pipe was escaping with gas.
    "
1	". There is a slight lexical mistake that you could improve upon to make the sentence more natural and idiomatic. The word ""bubbled"" does not quite fit well with the image of water coming out of a kettle. Instead, you might want to use the verb ""boiled"" or ""poured"" to convey the idea better. Here's an example:
    Water boiled up out of the kettle. "	". The correct version of your sentence is: Water boiled up out of the kettle.

1	". There is a slight lexical mistake in your sentence. The word ""leaked"" should be replaced with the word ""leaking"". Leaked is the past tense of leak, and it doesn't fit well in this context where you are describing an ongoing action. So, instead of saying ""The tub leaked water"", you could say ""The tub is leaking water.""

    "
1	". The only thing that could be improved is the word order. Instead of ""What the water did to the whole bottle was fill it,"" you could say ""The water filled the entire bottle."" This changes the emphasis from what the water did (which might not be immediately clear) to what the result of the action is (the bottle being full).

        - You might also consider adding a preposition like ""out of"" or ""from"" after ""tank"" to clarify where the liquid is coming from.
    "	". Here's the corrected sentence: The tank was leaking liquid out of it.

1	". There is a potential lexical mistake, as ""lay"" is typically used to describe an action of placing something down gently, while ""put"" or ""place"" might be more appropriate here since you are describing the act of putting the ball into the box. However, it's not a strict grammar mistake.
    "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: John put the ball in the box.
    "
0	". The verb ""owns"" is a transitive verb and requires an object to receive the action of owning. In this case, you need to add a prepositional phrase or an adverbial phrase indicating what John owns. For example:
        Sentence: John owns the book on the table.

Here is your original sentence again with the suggested improvement: Nora sent the book.

    "
1	". There is one potential issue with the word ""slid"" - it might be more appropriate to use the verb ""slipped"" instead, as ""slide"" typically implies a smooth and continuous motion, whereas ""slip"" can imply a sudden or unexpected movement. However, this is not strictly a grammar mistake, and your sentence is still understandable.
    "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: Carla slipped at the book.

    "	". Here is the correct version of your sentence: Amanda carried the package to Pamela's house. (Adding ""house"" after Pamela clarifies where she lives.)
    "
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""Packages"" is a plural noun, so the verb should be ""drive"" instead of ""drives"". Additionally, the word ""easily"" is an adverb and it doesn't agree with the verb tense. It would be better to use the adjective ""smoothly"" or ""quickly"" instead.

1	". There is one potential error that you might want to consider revising. The verb ""tape"" can be a bit ambiguous because it could refer to either the act of attaching something with tape or creating an audio recording. To avoid this confusion, you might prefer to use the more specific verb ""hang"" instead:
    Linda hung the picture on the wall.

Also, you could use the word ""hang"" instead of ""onto"" to make the sentence more concise and natural-sounding. So the corrected sentence would be: Linda taped the picture hang on the wall. "	". The correct version of your sentence is: Linda hung the picture on the wall.

    "	". The correct version of the sentence is: ""I shaped a loaf of bread."" (Note that ""loaf"" can be considered an uncountable noun, so it doesn't need an article like ""a"". Also, adding ""of bread"" to the end of the sentence makes it more specific and clear.)
    "
1	". The only thing that might be considered a slight mistake is the use of ""amused"" as a verb. While it can be used as a verb, it's more common to use it as an adjective describing something that brings pleasure or entertainment. For example: ""The children were amusing.""
    "	". Here's the correct version of your sentence with the suggested improvements: The children were amusing.
    "
1	". There is a slight lexical mistake. The word ""whispered"" should be changed to ""whispers"". Whisper is an action that happens continuously, so it requires the present tense form of the verb.
    "	". Here's the correct version: Susan whispers the news.
    "
1	". There is a possible error with verb tense consistency. The verb ""whispered"" is in the past tense, but the subject ""Susan"" is in the present tense. It would be more consistent to use the same tense throughout the sentence.
    "	". Here's the correct version of your sentence: Susan whispers at Rachel.

1	". ...I do notice a couple of potential areas for improvement. Firstly, ""about the present conditions"" is a bit wordy and could be shortened to simply ""the present conditions."" Additionally, it would sound more natural to use the verb tense that matches the time frame you're describing. Since Ellen said something about the current state of affairs, it would be better to use the present perfect tense instead of the simple past tense.

1	". There is a small lexical mistake that you might want to consider correcting. The word ""doughnut"" should be spelled as two separate words, ""dough nut"".

1	". There is a potential error in the word choice of ""afraid"" as it may not be the most appropriate verb to use in this context. The word ""afraid"" typically implies a fear or anxiety response to something specific, rather than just being afraid of someone in general. However, without more context, it's difficult to say for certain if this is an error or not.

In this case, you might want to consider using a different verb that better fits the context of your sentence. "	". The correct version of your sentence could be: ""Kim relies on Sandy.""

1	". The word ""Athena"" is not capitalized because it is not the first word of the sentence. Additionally, you may want to use a question mark at the end of the sentence instead of a period to indicate that it is a question. Here's the corrected version: Did Athena help us? "	". The correct version of your sentence is: ""Did Athena help us?""
    "
0	". The phrase ""the man I saw"" could be rephrased to make it clearer that you are referring to someone specific. For example: ""You wanted to meet the man whom I saw."" This revised version puts the emphasis on the person you were trying to meet, rather than just using a vague pronoun.
    "	". The correct sentence would be: You wanted to meet the man whom I saw.

1	". There is one potential error that you might want to consider revising. The word ""demonized"" can be a bit tricky because it has multiple meanings and connotations. In this context, it could be interpreted as meaning that Anson was actively trying to demonize or portray David in a negative light every day. However, the word might also suggest that Anson had some kind of supernatural power to actually turn David into a demon! To avoid any confusion, you might want to consider using a different verb that better captures your intended meaning. "	". Here's the sentence with these revisions: Anson

1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct! Well done! Here's the sentence again, written in ""marks"" for clarity: There is a programme about Euripides on Radio 4 tonight?
    "	". The correct version of the sentence is: There is a program about Euripides on Radio 4 tonight? Note that I changed ""programme"" to ""program,"" as the former is British English and the latter is American English. Additionally, I added an s to ""tonight"" to make it plural because you are referring to multiple programs airing tonight.

    "	". Here is the correct version of your sentence: The elixir was hidden in a hole in the ground.
    "
0	". The mistakes I see are:
        - ""Extremely frantically"" should be one word, not two separate adverbs. It should be ""extremely frantic"".
        - There should be a comma after ""Anson danced"" to separate the independent clause from the prepositional phrase ""at Trade 1"".
    "	". The correct version of your sentence is:
sentence: Extremely frantic, Anson danced at Trade 1.
    "
0	". The first mistake is that you have asked a question with an indirect object instead of a direct object. In English, we usually ask questions using the verb form that takes the subject and any direct objects, rather than the indirect object. For example, ""What did you give Medea?"" instead of ""What did you ask who Medee gave?""
    "	". The second mistake is that you have used a relative pronoun (who) in place of an adverbial clause modifying the verb ""ask"". In this case, it would be better to use a subordinating conjunction like ""that"" or ""which"", followed by the adverb

1	". There is a minor lexical mistake that you could improve upon. Instead of ""It's Anson that I like,"" it would be more idiomatic to say ""I like Anson."" This change will make the sentence sound more natural and fluent.

1	". However, there is a potential lexical mistake that could be improved upon. The word ""try"" does not fit well with the intended meaning of the sentence. Instead of trying to poison her children, Medea might have attempted or succeeded in poisoning them. Here's an example:
    Sentence: Medea attempted/succeeded in poisoning her children. "	". The correct version of your sentence would be:
     Sentence: Medea attempted/succeeded in poisoning her children.

0	". The word ""know"" should be replaced with ""knew"" because you are referring to the past tense of feeling. Here's the corrected version: I felt that I knew you.
    "	". Sentence: I felt that I knew you.
Please note that while there is no strict grammar mistake, using ""know"" instead of ""knew"" can make your sentence sound less natural and may cause confusion for native English speakers. It's a minor lexical mistake that can be improved for better clarity and fluency.

"
1	". The word ""can"" is not necessary in the sentence as it implies a possibility that may not be true. Instead of asking if he can do something, you could simply ask if he will do it or if he intends to do it. Additionally, using ""he"" without any context or noun before it makes the sentence sound vague and unclear.
    "	". Here's the corrected version: Will he do it? This is a more direct and clear way of asking about someone's intentions or

"
1	". There is a potential error with verb agreement. ""I ate"" is in the past tense, but ""she was happy"" is in the present state. It would be more appropriate to use the past participle of ""eat"" (ate) and change ""was"" to ""had been.""
    "	". The correct version of your sentence could be: I ate that she had been happy.
    "
1	". ...the phrase ""himself to be"" is a bit awkward and could be rephrased for better flow and clarity. Here are two possible alternatives:
       - Anson believed himself handsome. (Simple and straightforward)
       - Anson thought he was handsome. (More conversational and common)
    "	". So, the correct version of your sentence would depend on the tone you want to convey. If you prefer a more formal tone, you could use the first alternative: ""Anson believed himself handsome."" If you'd rather go for a more casual tone, the second alternative might

1	". There are a few minor issues that you could improve to make the sentence more clear and natural-sounding. Here they are:
        - The phrase ""about six o'clock"" is a bit vague. It would be better to use a specific time, like ""at six o'clock"" or ""around 6pm"".
        - The word ""1."" at the beginning of your sentence is unnecessary and can be removed.
    "	". Here's the correct version of your sentence: We arrived at six o'clock.
    "
1	". There is one potential issue with the verb tense consistency. The verb ""is"" indicates a present state, but ""had fought"" suggests that the action of fighting took place in the past and is no longer ongoing. To fix this, you could change ""had fought"" to ""fought"" to maintain consistency in the present tense.
    "	". Here's the correct sentence: Gilgamesh has fought the dragon.
    "
0	". The phrase ""thought that himself"" could be rephrased as ""thought he was happy"" or ""believed he was happy."" This would simplify the sentence and avoid any possible confusion about the subject of the thought.
    "	". Here is the correct version of your sentence: Anson believed he was happy.
    "
1	". There is a minor lexical mistake - ""biology 1"" should be ""Biology 1"". The number after the name of the subject indicates that it is a specific course or level, so it should be capitalized.
    "	". Here's the correct version of your sentence: Fortunately, Hermione passed Biology 1.
    "
0	". The word ""not"" is unnecessary and can be removed to make the sentence more concise. Additionally, it would be better to use the present simple tense instead of the past simple tense because you are expressing your intention for the future. Here's the corrected version: I might go to the party instead of washing my hair.
    "	". The correct version of the sentence is: I might go to the party instead of washing my hair.
    "
0	". The main mistake is that you have used the word ""myself"" incorrectly. You should use ""me"" instead of ""myself"" when referring to yourself as the object of a verb or preposition. Additionally, the word order is not correct - it should be ""I thought he liked me,"" not ""I thought he liked myself.""
    "	". Here's the corrected sentence: I thought he liked me.

1	". ...I do notice a couple of potential issues with word choice and phrasing that could be improved upon.

1	". The phrase ""what did you ask"" is not idiomatic and sounds a bit awkward. Instead of asking about what someone asked, it would be more natural to rephrase the question as ""What did you ask about?"" or simply ""What were you asking?""
    "	". Additionally, the word ""who"" in your sentence is unnecessary and can be removed. The correct version of the sentence without any errors would be: What did you ask about?

    "
0	". The verb tense is inconsistent. You start with ""He can"" which is present ability, but then switch to ""will go"" which is future intentions. To fix this, you should choose one verb tense and stick to it throughout the sentence. For example, if you want to express a future intention, you could say ""He will go"".
    "	". Here's the correct version of your sentence: He will go.
    "
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""How fierce"" is singular, but ""the battle"" is plural. To fix this, you should change the verb to the third person singular form ""is"".
    "	". Here's the correct version of the sentence: How fierce is the battle?
    "
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""Which king"" is singular, but ""did you ask"" is plural. To fix this error, change ""ask"" to the singular form ""asked"".

Depending on the context of your writing, you may want to consider using a more neutral term like ""feral pigs"" or ""wild boars.""

Here's the sentence with these suggestions incorporated: It is some feral pigs in the muddy fields near

Additionally, using ""burn"" as a verb without any additional context can make the sentence seem quite forceful and aggressive. "	".

Instead of using it to describe Aphrodite, you might consider using a more appropriate adjective or phrase to convey her power or influence. For example: It stinks that Aphrodite has so much power over love and beauty. "	". Here is your original sentence again in corrected form: It stinks that Aphrodite has so much power over love and beauty.

You could rewrite the sentence using the more common phrase ""Will Anson come to the party?"" "	". Here's your original sentence again, with the potential error highlighted:
    Will Anson come to the party?
     Sentence: Will Anson go to the party?

1	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""The bookcase"" is a singular noun and requires a singular verb form. Instead of ""ran"", the correct verb form should be ""runs"". Additionally, there is no need to use ""the"" before ""bookcase"" as it is already implied by the noun itself.
    "	". The corrected sentence would be: ""The bookcase runs.""
    "
1	". There is a possible improvement you could make to the sentence, but it's not strictly a mistake. The word ""myself"" can be considered more formal or literary than necessary in this context. You might consider using ""I"" instead, for greater clarity and simplicity: I shaved myself.
    "	". Sentence: I shaved.
