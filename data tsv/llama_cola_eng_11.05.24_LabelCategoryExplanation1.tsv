      USER: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help.
"
0	syntax	" The word ""would"" appears twice in the same clause, which creates an ambiguity and makes the sentence difficult to understand. It would be better to use only one instance of ""would"" and rephrase the sentence accordingly. Here's a corrected version: The more you want, the less you eat.
      4. Additionally, there is a minor punctuation error in your original sentence. A comma should be placed after ""eat"" to separate two independent clauses. So, the correct sentence would be: The more you would want, the less you, eat.
"
0	syntax	" The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. The subject ""the more John eats"" is plural, but the verb ""pay"" is in singular form. To fix this mistake, you should use the plural form of the verb ""pay"" to agree with the subject. Here's the corrected sentence: I demand that the more John eats, the more they pay.

0	syntax	" You have written a list instead of a complete sentence. To fix this, you should use a period at the end of the sentence and make sure that all the words are in the correct order. Here's an example of how your sentence could be corrected: Mary listens to the Grateful Dead; she gets depressed.
      4. Additionally, it would be more appropriate to use ""she"" instead of ""Mary"" as the subject of the sentence, since ""Mary"" is already mentioned in the previous clause. So, the corrected sentence could be: She listens to the Gr

      4. None.
"
0	syntax	" The phrase ""the ball from the tree"" is not grammatically correct because it should be ""the ball that was in the tree"" or ""the tree's ball"". In this case, you need to use a preposition like ""in"" or ""that"" to indicate the location of the ball.
      USER: Thank you so much! I appreciate your help and explanation!
"
0	syntax	" The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. The verb ""escaped"" should agree with the subject ""tube"", but it does not. Instead of ""escaped"", the correct form of the verb would be ""escapes"". Additionally, there should be a plural form of ""gas"" since you are referring to multiple gases escaping from the tube. So, the corrected sentence would be: The tubes were escaped by gas.

      4. None.
"
0	syntax	" The word ""free"" should be an adverb to modify the verb ""leaked"", but it is not necessary in this context because the meaning of the sentence is already clear without it. Therefore, you can remove the word ""free"" and the sentence will still make sense. Here's the corrected sentence: The tank leaked fluid.

In English, when using the present perfect tense with a singular subject (George), we use the auxiliary verb ""has"" instead of ""had"", and we add an ""-n't"" ending to the verb in informal speech.

      "
0	syntax	" In your sentence, ""who Medea had poisoned"" should be ""whom Medee had poisoned."" The correct word to use when referring to the object of a verb or preposition is ""whom,"" not ""who."" So, the corrected sentence would be: ""I wondered whom Medea had poisoned.""
      4. None of the other options (morphology or semantics) apply in this case.
"
0	syntax	" The word ""when"" should be changed to ""if"" because you are asking about a hypothetical situation rather than an actual event that has already occurred. Therefore, the correct sentence would be: I inquired if we could leave.
"
0	syntax	" The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""They"" is a third-person plural pronoun, but ""kicked"" is a verb that agrees with a singular subject. To fix this mistake, you should change the verb to the third-person plural form ""kick."" So, the corrected sentence would be: They kicked them.
      4. None.
"
0	syntax	" The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""The monkey"" is singular, but ""ate"" is a plural verb form. It should be ""eat"" instead. Additionally, ""the banana"" should be in the accusative case to match the verb ""ate"". So, the corrected sentence would be: ""The monkey eats the banana.""

"
0	syntax	" The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""The bookcase"" is a singular noun and should be followed by a singular verb form, such as ""ran"". Instead, you used the plural verb form ""1."" which does not agree with the subject. To fix this mistake, change the sentence to ""The bookcase ran.""
      4. None (There are no other mistakes in your sentence.)
"
0	syntax	" The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. You should use ""I shaved"" instead of ""I shaved myself.""
      4. Here's the corrected sentence: I shaved.
"
0	syntax	" Your sentence should read ""Anson became muscle-bound"" instead of ""Anson became a muscle bound."" The word ""muscle-bound"" is one word and should not be hyphenated. Additionally, the phrase ""muscle-bound"" should be used as an adjective to describe Anson's physique, rather than being made into a noun.
      4. None of the other options apply in this case."
