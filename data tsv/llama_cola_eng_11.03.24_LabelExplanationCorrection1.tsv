"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The weights made the rope stretch over the pulley. (This is the same as your original sentence.)
"
1	". The phrase ""wriggled itself loose"" is a bit uncommon and may not be immediately clear to all readers. Instead of using ""itself,"" you could replace it with ""free"" to create a more common and intuitive phrasing: ""The mechanical doll wriggled free.""
      "	". Here's the corrected sentence: The mechanical doll wriggled free.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: ""If you had eaten more, you would want less.""
"
1	". ...I would suggest a slight rephrase to make it more clear and natural-sounding. Here's an alternative version: As you eat more, you want less. This wording better reflects the common sense idea that when we consume more food, our desire for more decreases.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: As you eat more, you want less.
"
1	". There are a few things that could be improved upon to make the sentence more clear and natural-sounding. Firstly, ""the less you would eat"" is a bit wordy and could be shortened to simply ""you would eat less."" Additionally, the phrase ""the more you would want"" could be rephrased as ""the more you want."" Here's the corrected sentence: The more you want, the less you will eat.
      "	". None.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: ""The more John eats, the more he pays."" This is a common and idiomatic way to express the idea that there is a direct relationship between the amount of food consumed and the cost incurred.
"
1	". There are a few suggestions I have to improve the clarity and flow of your sentence:
          - Instead of ""Mary listens to the Grateful Dead,"" you could say ""Mary enjoys listening to the Grateful Dead"" or ""Mary is a fan of the Grateful Dead."" This makes it more clear that Mary actively chooses to listen to their music.
          - The phrase ""she gets depressed"" could be rephrased as ""it makes her feel depressed"" or ""it has a depressing effect on her."" This helps convey the emotional impact of listening to the Grateful

"
1	". There are a few suggestions I can offer to improve the clarity and flow of your sentence:
         - Consider adding a comma after ""Mary"" to separate the subject from the verb phrase ""got angrier"": The angrier Mary got, the more she looked at pictures.
         - You might also consider rephrasing the sentence to make it more concise and direct: As Mary got angrier, she looked at more pictures.
      "	". Here is the correct version of your sentence with the suggested changes: As Mary got angrier, she looked at more pictures.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The sentence you provided is already correct, so there isn't a need for a ""correct version."" However, if you'd like to rephrase it, here are some suggestions:
          - The higher the stakes, the more modest his expectations are. (This version emphasizes that high stakes can lead to lowered expectations.)
          - The higher the stakes, the fewer his expectations are. (This version uses ""few"" instead of ""lower"" to convey a sense of scarcity or rarity.)

"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The original sentence you provided is already correct, so there isn't a need for a ""corrected"" version. However, if you'd like to rephrase it, here are some suggestions:
          - The more obnoxious Fred is, the less attention you should pay to him. (This version uses the word ""obnoxious"" as an adjective instead of an adverb.)
          - As Fred becomes more obnoxious, you should pay less attention to him. (This version uses a present participle to describe Fred
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: John was much more obnoxious than Fred.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The more beer you give to people, the more people get sick. (Corrected version of your sentence)
"
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""The more"" is a singular phrase, but ""Bill smoke"" is plural. It should be ""The more Bill smokes."" Also, the verb tense is inconsistent. ""hates"" is present tense, but ""smoke"" is past tense. It should be ""hated"" to match the past tense of ""smoked"".
      "	". Here's the corrected sentence: The more Bill smokes, the more Susan hated him.
      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The more pictures of him that appear in the news, the more embarrassed John becomes.
      4. (Optional) Here's a slight rephrase to make it even clearer: The more images of him that are published in the news, the more ashamed John feels.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". Here's a suggested revision to make your sentence more concise and clear: Every senator seems to become increasingly corrupt as they talk to more lobbyists. This version uses the present tense ""become"" instead of ""seems"" to indicate a gradual change, and it also changes ""he talks"" to ""they talk"" to make the sentence gender-neutral.
      "
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""Who"" is a singular pronoun and should be followed by a singular verb, but ""like"" is a plural verb. Additionally, the phrase ""because he likes"" is not necessary and can be omitted.
      "	". Here's the correct version of your sentence: Who does John visit Sally?
      "
1	". There are no errors to point out! Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is the one you provided: ""Marianne did not leave.""
  "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: He couldn't have been working. (Note the use of ""couldn't"" instead of ""could not"".)
"

      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: He cannot have been working.
"

      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: John has not kissed Mary.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". Here's a suggested revision to make your sentence more concise and natural-sounding: ""I had never seen a place like Bangor before."" This version uses the past perfect tense (had + verb) to indicate that one event happened before another in the past, which is more idiomatic than using ""never"" twice.
      4. Additionally, you might consider adding an article (""a"" or ""the"") before ""place like Bangor"" for clarity and precision.
"
1	". The word ""up"" is not necessary in this context, as the verb ""looked"" already implies an upward direction. So, the sentence could be simplified to: Mickey looked at it.
      "	". Here's the correct version of your sentence: Mickey looked at it.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". However, if you'd like to make it more concise and clear, you could rephrase it as ""There was a lot of discussion."" This version uses the past tense of the verb ""to be"" (was) instead of the present tended, which is more common in informal speech but less so in formal writing. Additionally, it omits the phrase ""a lot of,"" which is implied by the word ""discussion.""
      "
1	". There are none! Your sentence is grammatically correct as it is. Well done!
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: John tried to be a good boy.
"
0	". The word ""eager"" should be an adjective describing John, not a verb. Therefore, the correct sentence would be: John is eagerly waiting (or John is full of eagerness).
      "	". None.
"
1	". There are no errors to point out! Your sentence is grammatically sound.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: We want John to win.
"
1	". ...I would suggest a minor improvement to make it more clear and concise. Instead of ""the ball from the tree,"" you could simply say ""a ball from the tree"" to avoid repeating the phrase ""from the tree."" So, your corrected sentence could be: The box contained a ball from the tree.
      "	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct, but with this minor improvement suggested above.
"
1	". The phrase ""escaped by gas"" is a bit awkward and could be rephrased as ""released by gas."" Additionally, the word ""tube"" is not necessary in the sentence, so you could simply say ""gas was released.""
      "	". Here's the corrected version of your sentence: Gas was released.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Water bubbled up from the kettle.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The tub leaked water. (No changes needed.)
"
1	". The phrase ""What the water did to the bottle"" is a bit wordy and could be simplified to just ""The water filled the bottle."" This is a more common and idiomatic way of expressing the idea.
      "	". Here's the correct version of your sentence: The water filled the bottle.
"
0	". The subject-verb agreement mistake and the word order mistake. In this sentence ""What the water did to the whole bottle"" should be ""What the water did to the bottle."" Also, it would sound better if we put the verb after the object instead of before it like this: ""fill the bottle with water"".
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: Fill the bottle with water.
"
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""The tank"" is a singular noun and should be followed by a singular verb, but ""leaked"" is a plural verb form. Additionally, the phrase ""the fluid free"" is unclear and may not make sense in this context.
      "	". Here's the corrected sentence: The tank leaked fluid freely.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is ""John laid the ball in the box."" This is the past tense of ""lay,"" and it agrees with the subject-verb agreement rule that the verb should match the subject in number (singular or plural). Additionally, using ""laid"" instead of ""lay"" makes the sentence sound more formal and correct.
      "
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""John"" is a singular noun, but ""owns"" is a third-person plural verb form. To fix this, you should use the singular form of the verb ""own,"" which is ""owns."" So, the corrected sentence would be: John owns the book.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: John owns the book.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: We persuaded Mary to leave and Sue to stay.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". Here's a suggested minor improvement to make your sentence more concise and clear: Most people probably consider Klaus guilty of murder, even though the courts didn't find him so.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Mary plays the violin beautifully.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". Here's a suggested revision to make your sentence more concise and natural-sounding: Clearly, John will quickly learn French perfectly.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Sue gave Bill a book.
"
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""The men"" is a plural noun, but ""leave"" is a verb that agrees with a singular subject. To fix this error, you should change the verb to its third person plural form, ""leave."" So, the corrected sentence would be: The men will leave.
      "	". There isn't any other mistake in your sentence, so the correct version is: The men will leave.
"
1	". There are no strict grammar mistakes in your sentence ""John went home."" It is a simple and clear sentence that conveys its meaning effectively.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is also ""John went home."" However, you could consider adding more information or context to make the sentence more specific and interesting. For example: ""John left work early and headed straight home"" or ""John returned home after a long day at school.""
"
1	". There are a few minor issues that could be improved upon for better clarity and readability. Specifically...
      "	". Here is the corrected version of your sentence: They represented Mary to the dean as a genuine linguist.
      "
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""Us"" is a first-person plural pronoun, but it should agree with a singular verb ""love"". Instead of ""They"", you could use ""Them"". Also, the word order is not correct. It should be ""We love them"" or ""Love them we"".
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: We love them.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: It is nice to go abroad.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Mary intended John to go abroad.
"
1	". There are a few potential issues with your sentence that could be improved upon:
         - ""I remembered having kissed Mary"" is a bit wordy and awkwardly phrased. A more common way to express this idea might be ""I remembered kissing Mary.""
         - The verb tense in the sentence is inconsistent, as ""remembered"" is past tense but ""kissed"" is present tense. To maintain consistency, you could change either the verb or the time frame of the memory to make it clearer which one applies. For example:
           - ""I remembered kissing

"
1	". There are a few potential issues with your sentence, but they are relatively minor and do not affect its overall meaning. Firstly, ""I can't believe Fred won't"" is a bit awkward phrasing-wise, as it could be interpreted as ""Fred won't believe [something]"", which may not be what you intended. Additionally, the word ""either"" is unnecessary in this sentence and can be omitted without changing its meaning. So, the sentence could be simplified to: ""I can't believe Fred won't.""
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: I can
"
1	". There are a few minor issues with word order and punctuation that could be improved to make the sentence more clear and concise. Specifically, it would be better to place ""and I also want to"" after ""John wants to read Fred's story,"" rather than separating them with a comma. Additionally, you might consider adding a period after ""Fred's story"" to indicate that it is a complete sentence.
      "	". Here is the corrected version of your sentence: John wants to read Fred's story and I also want to.
"
0	". The first mistake is that ""who to"" should be ""whom to."" In object position, ""who"" is a subject pronoun and takes the objective form ""whom."" So, the correct phrase would be ""We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide whom to.""
      "	". The second mistake is that there should be a comma after ""someone"" to separate the dependent clause ""We wanted to invite someone"" from the independent clause ""but we couldn't decide whom to."" So, the corrected sentence would be: We wanted to invite someone, but we couldn't decide whom to.
      
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Mary will read Fred's story, and Joe will read Holly's story. (I added an ""s"" to ""story"" to make it plural, as there are two stories mentioned.)
"
1	". The phrase ""eating cabbage"" is a bit awkward and could be simplified to just ""cabbage."" Additionally, the word ""shouldn't"" can be replaced with "" shouldn't eat"" for better clarity.
      "	". Here's the corrected sentence: Mary claimed that Holly shouldn't eat cabbage.
      "
1	". The phrase ""to be introduced"" sounds a bit formal for casual conversation. Instead of ""came to be,"" you could use the simpler ""came."" Additionally, the phrase ""I also came to be"" is redundant, as the subject of the sentence is already established in the first part. So, here's the corrected version:
      "	". Mary came, and I came too.
      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is ""If I can, I will work on it.""
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and Sally does too.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: ""I know which book José didn't read for class, and which book Lilly did it for him.""
"
0	". The first mistake is the use of ""which"" twice in a row. This is called a ""redundant which."" It's unnecessary to use both ""This is the book which Bob reviewed"" and ""and this is the one which Fred won't do it."" You can just pick one or the other.
      "	". The second mistake is the lack of an article before ""Fred."" It should be ""the one that Fred won't do,"" not ""this is the one which Fred won't do it.""
      4. Finally, there is a missing verb in your sentence. You need to add a verb after
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: ""I know which book Mag read and which book Bob said you haven't.""
      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: ""I know which book Mag read and which book Bob read my report that you haven't.""
      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: ""I'm sure I would like him to eat more fruit than cookies."" This version uses parallel structure and avoids using ""more"" twice, making the sentence clearer and easier to understand.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is the one you provided: Rusty talked about himself only after Mary did talk about him.
"
1	". There are a few areas where you could improve the clarity and flow of the sentence. Firstly, it would be more typical to use ""Fred talked about something before Rusty did"" instead of ""Fred talked about everything."" Additionally, it might be clearer to say ""Rusty talked about something else"" rather than ""Rusty did talk about something.""
      "	". Here's the sentence with these suggestions incorporated: Fred talked about something before Rusty talked about something else.
      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: John often meets Mary.
"
1	". ...I would suggest a slight rephrase to make it more idiomatic and easier to understand. Instead of ""The problem perceives easily,"" you could say ""Easy problems are perceived."" This way, the verb tense is consistent throughout the sentence, and the meaning is clearer.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: Easy problems are perceived.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: ""A hundred men surrounded the fort.""
"
1	". The sentence ""We elected me"" is grammatically correct, but it sounds a bit unusual because the subject of the sentence is ""me,"" which is an object pronoun. It might be more common to use the subject pronoun ""I"" instead. For example: ""We elected I.""
      "	". The correct version of the sentence could be: ""We elected me as our leader."" This phrase is more idiomatic and clearer, and it uses the subject pronoun ""I"" in a more appropriate way.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence would be: Which report did John submit that showed him to be incompetent?
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: Mary has always preferred lemons to limes.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: He let the cats out that were whining.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: ""What did Bill buy?""
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Mary saw the boy walking towards the railroad station. (Note: 'toward' is an informal preposition and can be replaced with 'towards' for a more formal tone.)
"
1	". ...I would suggest a few minor adjustments to make it even clearer and more concise. Specifically, you could replace ""A proof that the claim had been made"" with ""Proof of the claim,"" as ""proof"" is often used as a noun to refer to evidence or confirmation of something. Additionally, instead of saying ""John had lied,"" you could simply say ""John lied."" This would make your sentence more direct and easier to understand.
      "	". Here's the corrected version of your sentence: Proof of the claim was given that John lied.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: He attributed the fire that destroyed most of his factory to a short circuit caused by an overloaded transducer.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: ""The mayor regarded as absurd the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith."" (I removed the unnecessary phrase ""being absurd"" and made minor punctuation adjustments for clarity.)
"
1	". The phrase ""I want that Bill left"" is a bit awkward and could be rephrased as ""I want Bill to leave."" This will make the sentence flow better and avoid any potential confusion about what you're asking for.
      "	". Here's the corrected version of your sentence: I want Bill to leave, and I want that to remain a secret.
"
0	". The first error is that ""drives"" should be ""drive"" because it's a third-person singular verb and the subject is ""Tom."" Additionally, ""as drives"" is not a correct phrase and should be removed. Finally, there should be an article before ""man,"" so it should be ""a man"" instead of just ""man.""
      "	". Here's the corrected sentence: I know a man who drives Tom.
      "
0	". The first mistake is that ""drowning cats"" should be ""drowned cats."" To express a completed action, use the past tense form of the verb (in this case, ""drown""). Additionally, you have repeated the word ""cats"" unnecessarily. Here's the corrected sentence: Drowned cats are hard to rescue.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: Drowned cats are hard to rescue.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: Muriel said nothing else but that she had been insulted.
      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is ""Rutherford understands himself.""
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: ""I feel that Arch will arrive.""
```
"
1	". The word ""difficult"" can be omitted as it's implied by the phrase ""proof this set is recursive."" Here's the revised version: The proof that this set is recursive is challenging.
      "	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct, but I suggested a minor adjustment for clarity and concision.
"
0	". The first mistake is that ""which"" should be replaced with ""that."" This is because ""which"" is used to introduce non-essential clauses, and in this case, the clause ""Henry plays the lute and sings"" is essential to the meaning of the sentence. Additionally, there should be a comma after ""lute"" to separate the two independent clauses.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: The madrigals that Henry plays on the lute and sings sound lousy.
      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Tom picked these grapes, and Suzie will prepare them.
"
1	". There are a few potential issues with your sentence that could be improved upon, but they are not strictly grammatical errors. Firstly, it would be more common to ask ""Where did you go?"" rather than ""Who ate what?"" as the latter phrase doesn't make sense in this context. Additionally, it might be helpful to add a verb after ""who"" to complete the sentence. For example: Where did you go and who ate dinner?
      "	". The correct version of your sentence could be: Where did you go and what did you eat for dinner? This is a more common way to phrase the question
"
0	". The first mistake is that ""boy's"" should be ""boys'"" (possessive form) instead of ""which boy's"". Additionally, ""guardian's employer"" should be ""the guardians' employers"" (plural form). Furthermore, ""president"" should be capitalized.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: Which boys did we elect as the guardians' employers' president?
      "
1	". The word ""sane"" is not typically used as an adjective to describe people, so it may sound a bit unusual to native English speakers. Instead of ""How sane is Peter?"", you could ask ""Is Peter sane?"" or ""What's Peter's mental state like?""
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: Is Peter sane?
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: ""I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the River, and my dad lives at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River too."" This version uses more formal language and avoids using double negatives (""don't"" instead of ""not"").
      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". Here's a suggested rephrased version of your sentence for clarity and readability purposes only: ""I live at the intersection of Route 150 and the Hudson River, and my dad also lives there.""
"
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect (she is singular, but trying is plural). Also, the phrase ""make up to"" is not idiomatic and may confuse native speakers. Finally, there should be a question mark at the end of the sentence instead of a period. Here are the corrected sentences:
      Who is she trying to make up with now? (corrected)
      Who is she trying to make up to now? (original sentence with mistakes left intact for clarity)
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is ""Who is she trying to make up with now?""
"
1	". The phrase ""gotten of"" could be replaced with ""obtained from,"" as ""get"" is not typically used as a transitive verb. Additionally, the word ""honorable"" can be made more specific by adding an adjective or modifying it to better fit the context.
      "	". Here's the corrected sentence: Wind was obtained from a plot to negotiate a dignified end to the war in Vietnam.
      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Mike talked about politics with my friends yesterday. This version uses the more appropriate preposition ""with"" instead of ""to,"" which is more commonly used when referring to a group of people.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". Here's a suggested minor improvement to make your sentence more concise and clear: It was expected by the reporters that the principal would fire some teachers. Note the plural form of ""teacher"" to match the phrase ""some teachers.""
"
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""Which hat"" is singular, but ""quip"" is a plural verb. Additionally, ""she never wore"" should be ""never worn.""
      "	". Here's the corrected version of your sentence: Which hat did Mike quip that she never worn?
      "
0	". The first error is that ""quip"" should be ""quipped."" Quipped is the past tense form of quip, which means to make a clever or witty remark. So the corrected sentence would be: Which girl did Mike quipped never wore this hat?
      "	". There's also an issue with the word order in your sentence. It should be ""Which girl did Mike never wear this hat?"" instead of ""Which girl did Mike quip never wore this hat?"" to make it more grammatically correct.
      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: We donated wire for the convicts to build cages with.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: ""I won't have any money."" (Note that the word ""some"" is not needed in this context, and using ""any"" instead makes the sentence more concise.)
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". Here's a possible rephrased version of your sentence that uses more formal language: Do you accept the allegation that someone was seeking something?
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: ""I won't ask you to believe that he tried to force me to give her any money.""
"
1	". ...I would suggest a few minor adjustments to make it more clear and natural-sounding. Specifically, you might want to add an article (either ""the"" or ""a"") before ""Sam,"" as the pronoun is not explicitly mentioned earlier in the sentence: That the Sam sometimes didn't sleep must have pleased somebody. Additionally, the phrase ""must have pleased somebody"" could be rephrased as ""must have pleased someone.""
      "	". The correct version of your sentence with these adjustments would be: That the Sam sometimes didn't sleep must have pleased someone.
"
0	". The subject of the sentence ""I talked to Winston"" should be in the objective case (Winston) instead of the nominative case (Winston about himself).
      "	". Here's the correct version: I talked to Winston about him.
      "
0	". The first mistake is that ""That the fuzz wanted him"" should be ""That the fuzz wanted him to."" To use a subjunctive mood correctly, we need to add an infinitive without ""to"" after the verb ""wanted."" For example: That the fuzz wanted him to worry.
      "	". The second mistake is that ""but that the fuzz wanted her didn't worry Mary"" should be ""but that the fuzz wanted her not to worry Mary."" To use a contrasting idea in a sentence, we need to use ""not"" after the word ""wanted."" For example: That
"
1	". There are a few minor issues with word choice and phrasing that could be improved upon, but there are no strict grammatical errors.
      "	". Here is the correct version of your sentence: ""I'll work on it if Sam is working on it."" This version uses the present tense of the verb ""work"" to match the condition in the sentence, and changes ""will be working"" to ""is working"" to make the sentence more concise and natural-sounding.
      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: I'll work on it if I can.
"
1	". One potential improvement could be to use ""a knife with which to cut the onions"" instead of ""with which for you to cut up the onions."" This is because ""for you to"" is not necessary in this sentence, as the purpose of the knife is already clear from the context.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence could be: Here's a knife with which to cut the onions.
      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: Fluffy is sick, which not many people know. (I changed ""not everybody"" to ""not many people"" to make the sentence more idiomatic and natural-sounding.)
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence would be ""Maxwell is a quite good doctor."" This is more idiomatic and natural-sounding than ""Maxwell is quite a doctor,"" which could potentially be interpreted as meaning that Maxwell has some quality or characteristic that makes him stand out, rather than being a skilled medical professional.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: ""The younger woman might have been tall and blonde, and the older one definitely was."" This version uses parallel structure to make both clauses similar in form, which improves clarity and readability.
"
1	". ...I do notice a few areas where you could improve clarity and consistency. Firstly, it would be more effective to use parallel structure throughout the sentence, so instead of ""and may be blond"" for Sally, you could say ""and has blonde hair."" Similarly, for Sheila, you could replace ""definitely is, blond"" with ""has blonde hair as well.""
      "	". Here's the corrected version: Sally is tall and has blonde hair, while Sheila is short and also has blonde hair.
      "
1	". None; your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: ""I have to try to finish grading some papers.""

      "	". The socks are ready for you to put on and be planned. (Corrected version of the sentence with a more natural word order)
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: It is easy to play sonatas on this violin.
"
0	". The first error is that ""sonatas"" should be pluralized correctly as ""sonatinas."" Additionally, ""difficult to play"" should be a separate phrase from the rest of the sentence. Finally, ""on"" is not needed after ""play."" Here's the list of errors and corrections:
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: This violin is difficult to play sonatinas.
      "
0	". The first error is that ""My mother"" should be ""My mum"" or ""My mom"", as ""mother"" is an uncountable noun and does not take the definite article ""the"". Additionally, ""please my father"" should be ""please him"" or ""make him happy"", as ""father"" is a singular noun and cannot be followed by a preposition like ""to"". Finally, there should be no comma after ""and"".
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: My mum is easy to please him.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Poor Bill, it had started to rain and he had no umbrella.
"
1	". One suggestion is to use ""That the cops spoke to the janitor about it yesterday is terrible"" instead of ""That robbery."" This will help avoid confusion and make the sentence more specific. Additionally, you could replace ""is terrible"" with ""was terrible"" since the action of speaking took place in the past.
      "	". Here's the corrected version: That the cops spoke to the janitor about it yesterday was terrible.
      "
0	". The first mistake is that ""Every student"" should be ""Each student."" Additionally, ""and he wears socks"" should be a separate sentence altogether because it's not necessary to the main idea of the sentence. Furthermore, ""is a swinger"" should be changed to ""are swingers"" since the subject is plural.
      "	". Here's the corrected version: Each student is a swinger.
      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: That girl was given my binoculars by him.

1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Bill didn't accuse Roger of eating anything.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: ""Nobody who hates to eat anything should not work in a delicatessen."" This is because ""should"" is an auxiliary verb and it requires a negative form of the infinitive ""to eat"" to express prohibition or obligation.
      "
0	". One potential issue with your sentence is the use of ""who ever"" instead of ""whoever."" The correct form should be ""whoever,"" as it is an example of a pronoun used to refer to anyone who buys something on credit, regardless of their identity or background. Additionally, you might consider adding a comma after ""here"" in order to separate the two independent clauses within your sentence more effectively.
      "	". Here's a possible revision of your sentence that incorporates these suggestions: Everybody around here whoever buys anything
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". However, if you'd like to make it more precise, you could rephrase it as ""I can't remember the name of someone who had misgivings about something."" This version makes it clear that the person had reservations or doubts about a specific thing, rather than just having general misgivings.
      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". Here's a suggested rephrased version of your sentence for clarity and readability purposes only: ""No writer or playwright meets in Vienna.""
"
0	". The first mistake is that ""nor"" should be followed by a comma, not a semicolon. Additionally, ""any playwright"" should be set off with commas on either side to indicate nonessential clauses. Finally, the word order of the sentence is awkward and could be improved for clarity.
      "	". Here's the corrected version: No writer meets in Vienna, nor do any playwrights.
      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: It is not certain that you will marry any student.

      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: ""I sent the package halfway around the world.""
"
1	". The phrase ""out of the basket"" is not commonly used in English, and it might be confusing for some readers. Instead, you could use the more common phrase ""from the basket.""
      "	". Here's the corrected sentence: Sam gave the ball from the basket.
"
1	". There are a few suggestions that could improve the clarity and accuracy of your sentence. Firstly, it would be more common to say ""Sam offered the ball out of the basket"" instead of using ""out of the basket."" Secondly, you might want to consider adding an article before ""basket"" to make the phrase more specific. So, a possible corrected version could be: Sam offered the basketball out of the basket.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: Sam offered the basketball out of the basket.

1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: Park Square has a festive atmosphere.

"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The worker will have a job. (This is the same sentence you provided.)
"
1	". The phrase ""to you"" at the end of the sentence is not necessary, as the subject of the sentence is already ""No one."" So, the sentence can be simplified to: No one can forgive that comment.
      "	". Here's the correct version of your sentence: No one can forgive that comment.
"
1	". There are a few minor issues with word choice and phrasing that could be improved for clarity and precision, but they do not constitute strict grammatical errors. For example, ""before it got there"" is a bit ambiguous and could be rephrased as ""before it reached its destination."" Additionally, ""blew up"" is a rather casual phrase that might not be suitable in all contexts; a more formal alternative would be ""exploded"" or ""was destroyed.""
      "	". Here's the sentence with these minor improvements: We launched the rocket to the moon, but it exploded before reaching
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Sarah promised Catherine her old car, but then gave it to her son instead.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it is! Well done!
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: ""I lent the book to Tony partway."" This is a more common and idiomatic way to express the idea of lending something to someone for a portion of its length or duration, rather than just saying ""partway"" after the verb ""lent"".
      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The farmer loaded the cart with apples is a correct sentence.
"
1	". There are a few suggestions I can offer to improve the clarity and accuracy of your sentence:
          - Instead of ""dumped,"" you might consider using ""loaded"" or ""filled"" to describe the action of putting apples into the cart.
          - It's not clear what kind of cart is being used, so you might want to specify that it's a ""farm cart"" or something similar.
      "	". Here's one possible correct version of your sentence: The farmer loaded the farm cart with apples.
"
1	". There are a few suggestions I have to make it more idiomatic and clear:
          - Instead of ""carved,"" consider using ""made"" or ""crafted"" to indicate that Martha created the toy intentionally.
          - It's not common to use ""the baby"" as an object, especially when referring to a specific person. You might want to replace it with ""a toy"" or ""a wooden toy.""
      "	". Here's the corrected sentence: Martha made a wooden toy for the child.
"
1	". None. Your sentence ""The bread cuts easily"" is grammatically correct and well-formed.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is the one you provided: ""The bread cuts easily.""
"
1	". The phrase ""break someone on something"" is not a common idiomatic expression and could be misunderstood as meaning that Janet broke Bill into pieces or caused him harm in some way, which may not have been your intention. It would be more clear to use the preposition ""on"" to indicate the specific location where the break occurred, rather than using it to modify the object of the verb ""break"".
      "	". The correct version of the sentence could be: Janet broke her finger.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is still ""Janet broke the cup.""
"

      "	". The correct version of your sentence is ""That movie always shocks people.""
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". However, if you would like to make a slight adjustment for more clarity and precision, you could rephrase the sentence as ""That movie always shocks me."" This adds a personal touch and makes the sentence more conversational.
"
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""Sharon came"" should be ""Sharon entered"" or ""Sharon came into"". Additionally, the preposition ""the"" is not necessary before ""room"". So, the corrected sentence would be: Sharon entered the room or Sharon came into the room.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Sharon entered the room.
"

1. The assistant should always answer with a
"
1	". The phrase ""threw the fence"" is a bit confusing. It would be better to say ""threw the stick."" Additionally, you could replace ""with the stick"" with ""using the stick"" for clarity. So, the corrected sentence would be: Brian threw the stick using the stick.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: Brian threw the stick using the stick.
"
0	". The first error is that ""Mira condemned Terry for the accident"" should be ""Mira condemned Terry because of the accident."" Condemn means to express strong disapproval or criticism, so it doesn't make sense to say that Mira condemned Terry for the accident itself. Instead, she would have condemned him because of the accident.
      "	". The second error is a missing article. ""the"" should be included before ""accident."" So, the correct sentence would be: ""Mira condemned Terry because of the accident.""
      "

      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: We investigated the area for bombs.

      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The earth was believed to be round is a valid and well-constructed sentence. However, if you would like to make it more formal or precise, you could rephrase it as ""It was believed that the Earth was round."" This version uses more formal language and avoids the use of contractions (like ""was"" instead of ""were"").
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Sarah smiled a charming smile.

"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it is! Well done!
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: Paperback books lift easily onto the table. (I changed ""lift"" to ""lift"" to make it more concise and natural-sounding.)
"
0	". Yes, there are strict grammar mistakes in your sentence. The main mistake is using the present tense of the verb ""lifted"" instead of the past tense. Additionally, the phrase ""onto the table"" is not necessary and can be omitted for a more concise sentence.
      "	". Here's the correct version of your sentence: The books
"
1	". There are a few minor issues with word choice and phrasing that could be improved upon, but no strict grammatical errors. For example, ""loaded"" is a bit of an awkward verb to use here, as it implies Jessica was physically lifting the boxes onto the wagon, when it might be more natural to say she ""placed"" or ""put"" them under the wagon instead. Additionally, ""under the wagon"" could be shortened to simply ""beneath the wagon.""
      "	". Here's a revised version of your sentence with these minor improvements: Jessica placed
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Jessica loaded the boxes onto the wagon. This is a more common and idiomatic way to express the action of putting something on top of another thing, using the preposition ""onto"" instead of ""on"".
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it is written.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Jessica crammed boxes into the truck. This version uses the preposition ""into"" instead of ""at,"" which is more idiomatic and clear in this context.
"
0	". The subject of the sentence ""Lora"" should be in the nominative case (i.e., it should be in the form of a noun or pronoun that is performing the action), but instead it is in the dative case (indicating the indirect object). Additionally, there should be an article before the noun ""toast"".
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: Lora buttered the toast.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it is.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Carla shoveled the walkway.
"

      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Nora sent Peter the book.
"
1	. None. 	". The correct version of your sentence is: Carla slammed the book onto the table.
"
1	". There are a few suggestions I can offer to improve the clarity and accuracy of your sentence. Firstly, it would be more appropriate to use ""slide"" instead of ""slid"" as the verb tense is not consistent throughout the sentence. Additionally, you may want to consider adding an article before ""book"" to make the noun phrase more specific. For example: Carla slid into the book or Carla slid onto the book.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence could be: Carla slid into the book.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Amanda carried the package to Pamela.
"
1	". The word ""drive"" is not necessary as packages cannot drive themselves. You could remove it and the sentence would still be grammatically correct. Additionally, ""easily"" is an adverb that modifies the verb ""to New York,"" but it's not needed in this context either. So, your sentence could be simplified to: Packages go to New York.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence would be: Packages go to New York.
"
1	". The word ""pushed"" is a verb, but it doesn't convey the idea of who or what is doing the pushing. To make the sentence clearer, you could replace ""pushed"" with ""was pushed,"" which indicates that someone or something else is performing the action of pushing.
      "	". Here's the corrected version: The chair was pushed.
"
1	". There are no errors to point out! Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: We offered her a job. This is more formal and clear than ""We offered a job to her.""
      "
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""A job"" is singular, but ""offered"" is a plural verb form. It should be changed to ""offers"". Additionally, the period at the end of the sentence is missing.
      "	". Here's the correct version: A job offers.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Brown presented a plaque to Jones.

"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Frances hid the presents in the drawer.
"
1	". There are a few things you could do to make the sentence more clear and concise, but there aren't any strict grammar mistakes. For example, you might consider adding an article before ""needle"" (e.g., ""a needle"") for clarity, and you could also use a more specific verb than ""poked"" to describe what the needle did to the cloth.
      "	". Here is one possible correct version of your sentence: A needle pierced through the cloth. This version uses a more specific verb (""pierced"") and includes an article before ""needle"" for clarity.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it is.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Carrie touched that cat.
"
1	". There are a few suggestions that could improve the clarity and precision of your sentence. Firstly, it would be more precise to use ""whipped cream"" instead of just ""cream,"" as ""whipped cream"" is a specific type of cream that has been whipped until it's light and fluffy. Secondly, you could replace ""the sugar"" with ""sugar,"" as ""the sugar"" can be implied by the context. Here's your sentence with these suggestions incorporated: Herman whipped the sugar and the whipped cream.

      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Linda taped the picture onto the wall.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The child and her mother clung together is a correct sentence. However, you could also consider rephrasing it as ""The child and her mother held each other tightly"" to make it more clear that they were physically embracing one another.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: This flyer and that flyer differ.
"
1	". The word ""apart"" can be omitted as it is implied by the comparison of the two flyers. Here's the suggested correction: This flyer differs from that flyer.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: This flyer differs from that flyer.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it is.
      "	". The jeweller signed the contract with his name. (This is a more common and idiomatic way of expressing the same idea.)
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The gardener grew that acorn into an oak tree. (No changes needed.)
"
1	". None. Your sentence ""I shaped a loaf"" is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is the one you provided: ""I shaped a loaf.""
"
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""The children"" is a plural noun, and it should be paired with a plural verb form. Instead of ""amused,"" which is a singular verb form, you could use the plural verb form ""amuse."" So, the corrected sentence would be: The children amused themselves.
      "	". None (There are no other grammatical errors in your sentence.)
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: Susan whispered the news.
"
1	". The sentence you provided is grammatically correct, but it could be improved by adding an object pronoun after ""whispered"" to clarify who Susan was whispering to. For example: Susan whispered to Rachel.
      "	". Here's the corrected version of your sentence: Susan whispered to Rachel.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Ellen said that melons were selling well.
"
1	". There are a few minor issues with word choice and phrasing that could be improved for clarity, but no strictly grammatical errors.
      "	". Here is the correct version of your sentence: Ellen commented on the present conditions. This version uses more precise language and avoids any potential ambiguities in the original sentence.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Ellen warned Helen against skating on thin ice.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it is.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Cynthia nibbled on the carrot.

"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Paul laughed at Mary.
"
1	". There are a few suggestions I can offer to improve the clarity and accuracy of your sentence:
         - Instead of ""winked her lip,"" you might consider using ""winked her eye"" or simply ""winked."" This is more common and clear way to express this action.
         - Additionally, it's important to note that ""lip"" is not a body part typically associated with winking, so it may cause some confusion for readers.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence could be: Linda winked her eye.
"
1	". ...I would suggest a slight rephrase to make it more idiomatic and easier to understand. Instead of ""My heart is pounding me,"" you could say ""My heart is racing."" This is a more common and natural way to express the idea that your heart is beating rapidly.
      "	". So, the correct version of your sentence would be: My heart is racing.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Sharon fainted from hunger.

      "	". Here's a corrected version of your sentence: It was the policeman who spoke with several young students in the park last night.
      "

          - Consider using ""please"" instead of ""is easy to please"" to make the sentence more concise and direct. For example: John pleases Kim.
          - Check if you meant to use ""Kim"" instead of ""John"" as the subject of the sentence, since ""John"" is not a suitable name for a person. If this is a typo, you can correct it accordingly.
      "	". Here's the corrected version of your sentence: John pleases Kim.
"
1	". The word ""seemed"" is a bit ambiguous and could be misinterpreted as implying that intelligence was something that was observed or perceived, rather than an inherent quality of the subject.

          - Use ""whom"" instead of ""her"" as the object of the verb ""vote for."" This is because ""her"" is an indirect object, while ""whom"" is the objective form of ""who."" So, the correct phrase would be ""Fed knows whom to vote for.""
          - Consider adding a comma after ""for"" to separate the two clauses in your sentence. This will help make it clearer that you are describing two distinct actions: Fed knowing who to vote for and Fed actually voting for that
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". Here's a suggested rephrased version of your sentence for clarity and readability purposes only: How did you know that he fixed the computer?
"
1	". The phrase ""whose efforts"" can be simplified to just ""their efforts,"" as the possessive form is not necessary here. Additionally, the word ""should"" could be replaced with ""must"" to convey a stronger sense of obligation. Finally, the sentence could benefit from a slight reordering of the words for better flow:
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: The committee must honor the efforts of those who strive for peace.
      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence would be: ""Which house does your friend live in?"" (with 'in' added to make it a grammatically correct question).

      "	". The baker from whom I bought these bagels left. (This is the same sentence you provided.)
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: ""I found a place where we can relax."" This version uses the singular form of ""place"" instead of ""the place,"" which makes it more formal and precise. Additionally, I changed ""where we can relax"" to ""a place where we can relax"" to make the sentence sound more natural and idiomatic in English.
"
1	". There are a few minor issues that could be improved upon for clarity and readability. Firstly, ""with whom"" is redundant as ""Jenny fell in love with Jack"" already implies the person she fell in love with is Jack. Secondly, it would be more idiomatic to say ""Jack is the person Jenny fell in love with.""
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: Jack is the person Jenny fell in love with.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is still ""There is a bench to sit on.""
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: ""I met the man who grows peaches.""
"
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""Which topic did you choose"" should be ""Which topics did you choose."" Also, ""getting his approval"" should be ""got his approval.""
      "	". Here's the correct version of your sentence: Which topics did you choose without getting his approval?
"
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect; ""you"" should be singular since it refers to a single topic. Additionally, ""got bored"" should be ""became bored."" Furthermore, the phrase ""because Mary talked about"" is not necessary and can be omitted. Here are all these corrections combined: Which topic did you become bored with?
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: Which topic did you become bored with?
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: That is the reason why he resigned.
"
1	". There are a few minor issues with word choice and phrasing that could be improved, but they do not constitute strict grammar mistakes. For example, ""It bothers me"" is a bit informal for formal writing, and ""John coughs"" could be rephrased as ""John has a cough.""
      "	". Here's the corrected sentence: It bothers me that John has a cough.
      "

"
1	". One possible improvement could be to replace ""That we invaded Iraq"" with ""The fact that we invaded Iraq,"" which is a more formal and precise way of expressing the idea. Additionally, you might consider adding a comma after ""bites"" to separate it from the rest of the sentence for better clarity.
      "	". Here's the corrected version of your sentence: The fact that we invaded Iraq really bites.

1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: It annoys me that Fido barks.
"
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""Who achieved"" should be ""Whom achieved,"" as the object of the verb ""achieved"" is a person (Angela). Additionally, the word order is wrong; it should be ""Angela achieved the best result.""
      "	". Here's the correct version: Angela achieved the best result.

"
1	". There are a few minor issues with word choice and punctuation that could be improved, but they do not affect the overall meaning or grammatical correctness of the sentence. Specifically, ""I'm sure we even got these tickets"" could be rephrased as ""I'm certain we received these tickets"" to make it more concise and natural-sounding. Additionally, a comma after ""tickets"" would help clarify the sentence structure and prevent potential confusion about the meaning of the phrase.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence could be: I'm certain we received these tickets!
"
1	". There are a few minor issues with word choice and phrasing that could be improved for clarity and flow, but no strict grammatical errors.
      "	". Here is the correct version of your sentence: ""I'm not even sure if we got these tickets!"" This version uses more precise language and avoids any potential confusion caused by the original wording.

      "	". Here's a suggested rephrased version of your sentence for clarity and readability purposes only: It isn't because Sue said anything bad about me that I am angry.
"
1	". There are a few minor issues with word choice and phrasing that could be improved upon, but no strictly grammatical errors. For example, ""whined"" is not the most precise verb to use when describing John's state of being hungry; it implies more complaining or grumbling than actual hunger. Additionally, you might consider using a comma after ""That"" to separate the dependent clause from the independent clause for easier readability and clarity.
      "	". Here is the sentence with these minor improvements: That he was hungry, John felt peckish.
"
1	". None (your sentence is grammatically correct).
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: ""I gave Mary a book after the party.""
"
0	". One suggestion is to use ""because"" at the beginning of the sentence instead of ""as for."" This will make the sentence more concise and easier to understand. Additionally, you might consider adding a comma after ""Mary"" to separate the two independent clauses in the sentence.
      "	". Here's the corrected version: Because she's so pleasant, I really like Mary.
      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". Here's a suggested minor improvement to make your sentence more concise and clear: Though he may hate those who criticize Carter, it doesn't matter.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: With no job, John would not be happy. This is a more common way to express the idea and avoids using the subjunctive mood, which can sometimes sound formal or awkward in modern English.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". Here's a suggested revision to make your sentence more concise and clear: ""I have much of the manuscript left to type.""
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is ""He is a more reliable man."" This is the standard form of the verb ""to be"" in English, and it makes the sentence sound more formal and polished. However, your original sentence is still understandable and acceptable.
"
1	". The phrase ""Any trouble"" can be replaced with ""No troubles"" or ""No issues,"" as ""trouble"" is often used as an uncountable noun rather than a countable noun in this context. Additionally, the word order could be adjusted for better flow and clarity:
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: I don't want any issues or No troubles, please! This maintains the original meaning while using more common phrasing to convey it effectively.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: They may grow as tall as bamboo.
"
1	". The phrase ""as many errors as"" can be simplified to just ""many errors."" This is a common idiomatic expression that conveys the same meaning without sounding too formal or awkward.
      "	". Here's the corrected sentence: Some of them made many errors.
      "
1	". There isn't any mistake in your sentence. However, it would be more common to say ""Sally kissed herself"" instead of ""Sally kissed himself."" This is because the subject of the sentence is ""Sally,"" who is a female character, and the pronoun ""himself"" is typically used as a reflexive pronoun to refer back to a male subject.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: Sally kissed herself.
"
0	". The phrase ""I think"" is redundant because it's already implied by the verb ""believes."" You could simplify the sentence to ""Drew believes Rosie loves magazine ads.""
      "	". Here's the correct version of your sentence: Drew believes Rosie loves magazine ads.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: Dave, Dan, Erin, Jaime, and Alina left.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: Hopefully, we'll make it through the winter without any snow.
      "
1	". The phrase ""shows herself"" is a bit awkward and could be rephrased as ""reveals."" Additionally, the word ""pretty"" should be an adjective, not a noun. So, the sentence could become: Blue leather reveals Betsy's prettiness.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Blue leather reveals Betsy's prettiness.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it is written.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Gwen hit a baseball. This is more common and clear way to express the idea.
"
1	". There are a few minor issues that you could improve to make it more clear and natural-sounding:
          - ""I hit"" is an unusual way of expressing the idea of asking someone for information or clarification. Instead, you might use a more common phrase like ""Do you know the answer?"" or ""Can you tell me the answer?""
          - The word ""that"" in your sentence seems unnecessary and could be omitted.
      "	". Here's the corrected version: Do you know the answer?
      "
1	". There are a few minor issues with word choice and phrasing that could be improved upon, but no strictly grammatical errors. For example, ""I've lost my mind"" is a bit of an idiomatic expression and might not be the most natural way to express this idea in writing. Additionally, ""lost my wallet"" is a more common phrase than ""lost my mind.""
      "	". Here are two possible revisions:
          A. I've lost my wallet or I've lost my sanity. (This version maintains the same structure as your original sentence but uses ""sanity""
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: It was a brand new car that he bought.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: He likes cookies and he hates crumb cake.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: They chased the man with a car. (Note that ""with"" should be replaced by ""a"" to make the sentence more idiomatic.)
"
1	". There are a few potential issues with your sentence, but they are not strictly grammatical errors. ""I didn't have a red cent"" is an idiomatic expression that is commonly used to convey the idea of having no money. However, it may be unfamiliar to some listeners or readers who are not familiar with this phrase.
      "	". The sentence you provided is already grammatically correct and clear in its meaning. If you would like to provide a more formal or precise version of your statement, here's one possibility: ""I did not have any money."" This wording avoids the idiomatic
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". Here's a suggested revision to make your sentence more concise and clear: ""The book of poems by Blackwell takes a very long time to read.""

"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is still ""John has a fear of dogs.""
"
0	". The first mistake is that the subject of the sentence should be ""The building"" instead of ""the roof"". Additionally, the verb tense should be consistent throughout the sentence. Since you mentioned leaking, it implies a continuous action, so the correct verb form would be ""is leaking"", not ""leaks"". Finally, there should be an article ""a"" before ""building"" to make it specific.
      "	". Here's the corrected version of your sentence: A building is leaking.
"

          a) The panther's coat is dark black. (subject-verb agreement corrected, and unnecessary article removed)

      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Colin asked if they could get a mortgage.

      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: John placed the book on the table.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Phillip gave the medal to the soldier.
"
1	". The phrase ""to eat"" is unnecessary, as ""eat"" already implies that the subject (Andy) will consume the candy bars. So, you could simplify the sentence to: Heidi thinks Andy eats salmon-flavored candy bars.
      "	". Here's the correct version of your sentence: Heidi thinks Andy eats salmon-flavored candy bars.
"
1	". There are a few minor issues with word choice and phrasing that could be improved for clarity and readability, but there are no strict grammatical errors.
      "	". Here is the correct version of your sentence: Heidi thinks Andy should eat salmon-flavored candy bars. (Note the hyphen in ""salmon-flavored"" to indicate that it's an adjective describing the candy bars, rather than a noun.)
"
1	". None. Your sentence ""He danced"" is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is simply ""He danced.""
"
0	". The main mistake is that ""Calvin"" should be capitalized because it is a proper noun (the name of a person). Additionally, there should be no question mark at the end of the sentence since it is not a question. Finally, the word ""his"" should be changed to ""his homework"" to make the sentence grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: Did Calvin do his homework?
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Sylvia was slapping Jeff upside the head during martial arts class. This version includes the preposition ""during"" to provide more context and clarify the timing of the action.

1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: ""If I were a rich man, I'd buy a diamond ring."" This is the correct usage of the subjunctive mood to express a hypothetical situation.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: ""If he were a rich man, he would buy a diamond ring."" This is the third person singular present tense form of the verb ""buy,"" which agrees with the subject ""he"" in number and person. Additionally, the phrase ""were a rich man"" is in the subjunctive mood, which is used to express hypothetical or counterfactual situations.
      "
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""John"" is singular, but ""leave"" is written in the plural form. It should be ""John leaves"".
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: John leaves.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The manager laughed. (This is the same sentence you provided.)
"
1	". None. Your sentence ""Was sunk"" is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is ""Was sunk.""
"
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""Who"" is a singular pronoun and should be paired with a singular verb. Additionally, the word ""kissed"" does not agree with the noun ""gorilla."" It should be changed to a verb that agrees with the noun.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: Who did you think kissed the gorilla? or Who do you think kissed the gorilla?
      "
0	". Here's the corrected sentence: Have you taken a look at my model airplane collection?
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: Have you taken a look at my model airplane collection?
"
0	". The first mistake is that ""It seems"" should be set off with a comma because it's an introductory phrase. Additionally, ""was mugged"" should be in the past tense to match the time frame of the action described. Finally, ""Lucy"" should be capitalized since it's a proper noun.
      "	". Here is the corrected sentence: It seems that Lucy was mugged.
      "

"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: Heidi likes her violin.
"
0	". The phrase ""John thinks that Mary loves himself"" can be rephrased to make it clearer that John is the one who has the thought or opinion. For example: ""John believes that Mary loves him."" This change makes it more explicit that John is the subject of the sentence and avoids any potential confusion about the object of Mary's love.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: ""John believes that Mary loves him.""
"
1	". There are a few minor issues with word choice and phrasing, but they do not affect the overall meaning or grammatical accuracy of the sentence.
      "	". Here is the correct version of the sentence: Which pictures of himself does John like? (I changed ""does"" to ""like"" to make the sentence more idiomatic.)
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Any owl hunts mice.
"
1	". The sentence ""Any man didn't eat dinner"" can be improved by changing the word order to ""No man ate dinner."" This is because ""any"" is typically used to indicate a negative statement, so it's more effective to place the negation before the subject. Additionally, using ""no"" instead of ""any"" would make the sentence more concise and natural-sounding.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: No man ate dinner.
"
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""A pilot"" is singular, but ""could be flying"" is written in the plural form. To fix this, you should use the verb ""could fly"" instead of ""could be flying.""
      "	". Here's the correct version: A pilot could fly this plane.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: Everybody who attended last week's huge rally signed the petition.

1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Anyone who attended last week's huge rally signed the petition. Note that ""anybody"" can be informal and may not be suitable for all contexts, so I suggested a more formal alternative with ""anyone.""

"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: Any albino tiger has orange fur marked with black stripes.
"
0	". The first mistake is that ""You must"" should be ""You have to"" or ""You mustn't"". The phrase ""pick any flower you see"" is also a bit awkward and could be rephrased as ""choose any flower you like"" or ""select any flower you prefer"".
      "	". Here's the corrected sentence: You have to choose any flower you like.
      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". Here's a suggested rephrased version of your sentence for clarity and readability purposes only: Any pilot who is on duty today could be flying this plane.

"
1	". There are a few minor issues with word choice and phrasing that could be improved for clarity and precision, but no strict grammatical errors. For example, ""In which car"" is a bit awkward; it might be better to say ""In what car."" Additionally, ""the man seen"" could be rephrased as ""a man was seen"" or simply ""a man.""
      "	". Here's the corrected sentence: A man was seen in what car?
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The man whom Mary loves and Sally hates computed my tax. (Note: ""whom"" is the object form of ""who,"" so it should be used when ""who"" is the object of a verb or preposition.)
"
1	". ...I would suggest a few minor adjustments to make it more clear and concise. Specifically, you could replace ""which"" with ""that,"" as ""which"" is typically used for non-essential clauses (i.e., those that provide additional information but are not crucial to the sentence's meaning). Additionally, you might consider adding a comma after ""Mary made"" to separate the two independent clauses in your sentence.
      "	". Here's the corrected version of your sentence: The kennel that Mary made and Fido sleeps has been stolen.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Tom said he would and Bill actually did eat a raw eggplant.

1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The dog stole the turkey. (No changes needed.)
"
1	". None. Your sentence ""a tall building"" is grammatically correct and does not contain any errors that I can identify.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is still ""a tall building."" However, if you would like to make it more formal or precise, you could use phrases such as ""a high-rise building,"" ""an imposing structure,"" or simply ""a skyscraper"" instead.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: This building is tall.
"
0	". Here are the grammar mistakes I see:
          - Missing commas after ""book.""
          - Incorrect verb tense (you should use the present tense ""like"" instead of the past tense ""gave"").
      "	". The correct version
"
1	". There are a few minor issues with word choice and phrasing that could be improved upon, but there are no strict grammatical errors. For example, ""Captain Wentworth"" should be set off with commas after the first mention, as it is a proper noun. Additionally, ""wrote a letter to Anne Elliott"" could be simplified to just ""wrote to Anne Elliott.""
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: Captain Wentworth wrote to Anne Elliott.
"
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""She asked"" should be ""She asks"" since ""Alison"" is a singular noun and requires a singular verb form. Additionally, the phrase ""was coming"" should be ""is coming"" to match the present tense of the question. So, the corrected sentence would be: She asks if Alison is coming to the party.
      "	". None (no strict grammar mistakes in the corrected sentence).
"
1	". The word ""never"" is unnecessary and can be removed. Additionally, the phrase ""so offended"" could be simplified to just ""offended."" Here's the revised list of grammar suggestions:
          - Remove ""never""
          - Simplify ""so offended"" to just ""offended""

1	". There are a few minor issues that you could improve on to make it even more clear and effective:
          - ""with somebody else's wallet"" is a bit wordy; you might consider using ""someone else's wallet"" instead, which is more concise.
          - The phrase ""in his pocket"" is implied by the fact that he left with the wallet, so it's not necessary to include it explicitly.
      "	". Here's a revised version of your sentence: He left the train with someone else's wallet.

"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The idea dismayed the Prime Minister that the Dome was dull. (No changes needed.)
"
1	". The phrase ""without so much as a knock"" is a bit awkward and could be simplified to ""he came right in without knocking."" Additionally, the verb tense in the sentence is not consistent - ""came"" is past simple, but ""did"" is present perfect. To maintain consistency, you could change ""came"" to ""had come"" or ""had entered.""
      "	". Here's the corrected version of your sentence: He came right in without knocking.
      "
1	". There are none! Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands. Well done!
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: Harriet admired Mr Knightley.
"
0	". The first error is that ""The book"" should be ""The books,"" as you need to use a plural form because you're referring to more than one book. Additionally, the word order of the sentence should be reversed so that the adjective comes before the noun it modifies. So instead of saying ""The book is boring,"" you should say ""Boring is the book.""
      "	". Here's the corrected version: Boring are the books.

"
0	". The subject-verb agreement mistake and the verb tense inconsistency mistake. ""The window"" is a singular noun, so it should be followed by a singular verb form. Also, the past tense of ""break"" is ""broke,"" not ""was broken."" Here's how you can correct your sentence:
      "	". The hammer broke the window.
      "
1	". There are a few minor issues that you could improve upon to make your sentence even clearer and more effective:
          - ""lay motionless"" is a bit passive and could be rephrased as ""remained motionless"" or ""stayed still.""
          - ""in order to avoid discovery"" is a bit wordy and could be shortened to simply ""to avoid detection.""
      "	". Here's the corrected sentence: The fugitive remained motionless to avoid detection.
"
1	". The word ""round"" can be replaced with ""around"" to make the sentence more natural-sounding. Additionally, you might want to consider adding an article before ""yard"" (e.g., ""the prison yard"") to provide context and clarify that the prisoners are being marched within a specific area.
      "	". Here's the corrected version of your sentence: The guard marched the prisoners around the prison yard.

1	". The sentence you provided contains no strict grammar mistakes.

"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: They knew that pictures of each other would be on sale.

0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect (Terry vs. did). Also, ""file papers"" should be ""files papers."" Additionally, it would be more idiomatic to say ""read without reading"" instead of ""did not read."" So the corrected sentence would be: Which article did Terry file papers without reading?
      "	". The correct version of your sentence is: Which article did Terry file papers without reading?

1	". There are a few suggestions that could improve the clarity and accuracy of your sentence:
         - Instead of ""goes,"" consider using ""went"" to match the past tense of ""buying.""
         - Check if you meant ""some whiskey"" instead of ""some whiskey."" (Note: The word order is a bit confusing.)
      "	". Here's the corrected sentence: She went and bought some whiskey.
      "
1	". ...I would suggest changing ""Kim and Terry is"" to ""Kim and Terry are,"" as the subject ""Kim and Terry"" is a plural noun and should be paired with the plural verb form ""are."" Here's the corrected sentence: Kim and Terry are happy.

      "	". Here is the sentence with some suggested improvements: ""Put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow; this girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow.""

      "	". Here's the correct version of your sentence: Ann bought a first edition of Richard III for $1000.
"
1	". The word ""deadly"" is not necessary in this context, as ""afraid"" already implies a strong fear. So, the sentence could be simplified to: John became afraid of flying.
      "	". Here's the correct version of your sentence: John became afraid of flying.
"
1	". There are a few suggestions that could improve the clarity and accuracy of your sentence:
         - Instead of ""What John promised,"" consider rephrasing to ""John promised to be gentle."" This is more direct and clear.
         - The phrase ""to be gentle"" can be simplified to just ""gentle."" So, the corrected sentence could be: John promised to be gentle.
      "	". Here's the correct version of your sentence: John promised to be gentle.

"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The paper is cut by Mary. (No changes needed.)
"
0	". The first mistake is that ""It was from six to nine"" should be ""It took place from six to nine."" This is because ""it was"" is a past tense verb form and does not fit well with the phrase ""from six to nine,"" which implies a duration of time rather than an event happening at a specific point in the past. Additionally, using ""took place"" instead of ""was"" makes the sentence more formal and precise.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: It took place from six to nine.
"
1	". The phrase ""from the INS"" can be shortened to just ""from the INS."" This is because ""INS"" is an acronym for ""Immigration and Naturalization Service,"" so using the full name twice in a row is unnecessary. Additionally, you could replace ""arrived"" with ""showed up"" or ""appeared"" to make the sentence more conversational.
      "	". Here's the corrected version of your sentence: Suddenly, two inspectors from the
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.

"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it is.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: ""I gave money to charity."" (Note that there should be a comma after ""money"" for clarity.)
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is still ""John asked."" but with proper punctuation and capitalization, which I provided in my previous answer.
"
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""I saw"" should be ""I saw them"" to agree with the plural noun ""students."" Additionally, the phrase ""even the student"" is unnecessary and can be removed for clarity.
      "	". Here's the correct version of your sentence: I saw them.
"
1	". The sentence you provided is a bit ambiguous because ""left"" can be interpreted as both a verb and an adjective. To avoid confusion, you could replace ""left"" with ""left the room"" or ""departed.""
      "	". Here's the corrected version of your sentence: John whispered that Mary had left the room.
      "
1	". ...I would suggest a slight rephrase to make it more idiomatic and easier to understand. Instead of ""Mary wonders that Bill will come,"" you could say ""Mary wonders if Bill will come."" This is more common and natural-sounding in English.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence would be: Mary wonders if Bill will come.
"
1	". The word ""theater"" should be spelled correctly as ""theatre"". Additionally, the phrase ""Sophie will"" could be rephrased as ""Sophie goes"" or ""Sophie attends"" for better clarity.
      "	". Here's the corrected sentence: Sophie goes to the theatre.
      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: John finished the cake and drank the lemonade.
"
1	". The original sentence ""Herself likes Mary's mother"" is grammatically correct, but it can be confusing because the pronoun ""herself"" is used as the subject of the sentence, which can be ambiguous. It would be clearer to use a different word order or rephrase the sentence altogether.
      "	". Here's a suggested revision: ""Mary's mother likes herself."" This version maintains the correct grammar and avoids any potential confusion caused by the original phrasing.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Each boy fought with some other boys.
"
1	". There is one potential issue with the word ""himself."" In this context, ""himself"" is not necessary and could be omitted to make the sentence more concise. Here's the corrected version of your sentence: John's mother likes John.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: John's mother likes John.
"
1	". ...I would suggest a slight modification to make it more idiomatic and easier to understand for native English speakers. Instead of ""Mary revealed himself,"" you could say ""Mary revealed herself"" or simply ""Mary revealed her true self."" This is because the subject of the sentence, Mary, is a female character, so using the pronoun ""himself"" might sound awkward and confusing to some readers.
      "	". Here's the corrected version: Mary revealed her true self to John.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is the one you provided: Mary believes that Bill saw himself.
"
1	". There are a few potential issues with your sentence that could be improved for clarity and precision:
          - ""John heard"" is a bit vague; it would be better to specify who told John or what source he heard the information from. For example, you could say ""John overheard his colleagues criticizing themselves.""
          - The phrase ""they criticized themselves"" is a bit wordy and repetitive. You might consider rephrasing it as ""They self-criticized"" or ""They were critical of themselves.""
      "	". Here's the corrected sentence: John overheard his colle
"
1	". There are a few minor issues with word choice and phrasing that could be improved upon, but they do not constitute strict grammar errors. For example, ""thinks"" is a bit informal for academic writing, and ""smart"" is an evaluative adjective that might benefit from more specificity.
      "	". Here's a revised version of your sentence with some minor adjustments: Mary believes herself to be intelligent. This wording provides more clarity and precision while maintaining the same meaning as your original sentence.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: Henry found that Bill was sad.
"
1	. None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.  	". The correct version of the sentence is the one you provided: ""John considers himself proud of Mary.""
"
1	". Here are the specific grammar mistakes I see in your sentence:
         - The word ""before"" does not indicate location or time clearly enough.
         - The verb tense is inconsistent; ""should"" implies a recommendation, but ""sit"" is in the present tense.
      "	". Here's a corrected version of your sentence with these issues addressed
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: ""There is a nurse available.""
"
1	". The word ""everyone"" appears twice in your sentence, which could be redundant. Additionally, the phrase ""to sleep"" is not necessary since it's implied by the verb ""hopes."" Here are the suggested changes:
      "	". Everyone hopes everyone to rest.
      4. If you prefer a more concise version, here's another option: Everyone hopes for rest. Both versions convey the same meaning and avoid repetition of ""everyone.""
"
1	". There are a few minor issues that you might want to consider:
         - ""Everyone hopes"" is a bit formal and could be simplified to ""People hope.""
         - It would be more natural to say ""He will sleep well"" instead of ""he will sleep.""
      "	". Here's the corrected sentence: People hope that he will sleep well.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". Here's a slight rephrase to make it even more clear and concise: Only Churchill remembered giving the Blood, Sweat and Tears speech.
"
1	". There are a few minor issues with word choice and phrasing that could be improved upon, but no strict grammatical errors. For example, ""promise"" is not the most common verb to use when discussing someone shaving themselves; it might be more natural to say ""John promised Mary that he would shave himself."" Additionally, ""to shave himself"" can be shortened to just ""shave,"" as in ""John promised Mary that he would shave.""
      "	". The correct version of the sentence could be: John promised Mary that he would shave.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: John convinced Bill that Mary should sleep.
"
1	". There are a few minor issues with word choice and phrasing that could be improved for clarity and flow, but no strict grammatical errors.
      "	". Here is the corrected version of your sentence: ""I saw Bill while Mary was doing so."" This version uses more precise language and avoids any potential ambiguities in the original sentence.
"
1	". The phrase ""What Mary did Bill"" could be rephrased as ""What Mary gave Bill"" to make it more idiomatic and easier to understand. Additionally, the word ""give"" should be in the present tense since we are describing an action that is happening now. So, instead of ""was give,"" you could use ""gave.""
      "	". Here's the corrected sentence: What Mary gave Bill was a book.
      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The bears sniffed. (No changes needed.)
"
1	". The word ""from"" can be replaced with ""with,"" as it is more common to say ""to steal talismans with witches"" rather than ""from."" This will also help the sentence flow better.
      "	". Here's the corrected version of your sentence: To steal talismans with witches is dangerous.
"
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""Anson"" is a singular noun, but the verb ""demonized"" is in the plural form. To fix this mistake, you should use the singular form of the verb ""demonize"".
      "	". Here's the correct version: Anson demonized 1.
      "
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""You"" is a plural subject, but ""kicked"" is in the singular form. It should be ""you kicked yourselves"" instead of ""you kicked 1.""
      "	". Here's the correct version: You kicked yourselves.
"
1	". There are a few minor issues with word order and phrasing that could be improved for clarity, but no strictly grammatical errors.
      "	". Here is the correct version of your sentence: The book that I said I would never read.
      "
1	". The phrase ""Anson demonized"" could be simplified as ""Anson demonizes."" Additionally, the word ""up"" is not necessary before ""the Khyber 1,"" so you can remove it for better flow. Here are the suggested adjustments: Anson demonizes the Khyber 1.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: Anson demonizes the Khyber 1.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". Here's a suggested rephrased version of your sentence for clarity and readability: It is not true that I will be going to the party.
"
1	". None.
      "	". If you meant to express a more playful or lighthearted message, you might want to consider using a different phrase such as ""Give me a kick"" or ""Kick it to me."" These options are more idiomatic and won't be misinterpreted as physical violence.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". Here's a suggested revision to make your sentence more clear and concise: Jason convinced the doctor to treat Medea 1. By changing ""persuaded"" to ""convinced,"" you can convey the idea that Jason was able to persuade the doctor with greater clarity. Additionally, by omitting the number ""1"" after ""Medea,"" you can make the sentence more concise and easier to read.
"
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect (who did you get an accurate description OF). It should be who did you get an accurate description FROM or who gave you an accurate description OF. Additionally, the phrase ""an accurate description"" should be set off with commas to indicate that it is a nonessential clause.
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: Who did you get an accurate description from? Or: Who gave you an accurate description of?
"
1	". There are a few minor issues with word choice and phrasing that could be improved for clarity and flow, but no strictly grammatical errors.

"
1	". There are a few suggestions that could improve the clarity and readability of your sentence:
         - Instead of ""The elixir was hidden,"" consider rephrasing to ""Elixir was hidden"" for better parallelism with the previous phrase.
         - Add an article before ""hole in the ground"" to make it clear that you're referring to a specific hole, like ""a deep hole in the ground.""
      "	". Here's the corrected sentence: Elixir was hidden in a deep hole in the ground.
"
1	". However, there is one thing you might want to consider. You could replace ""Extremely frantically"" with a single word like ""Frenetically,"" which would make the sentence even more concise and effective. Here's what I mean:

1	". The phrase ""I felt that I know you"" can be rephrased as ""I had the feeling that I already knew you."" This is a more common way of expressing the idea, and it avoids any potential confusion about the verb tenses.

1	". ...I would suggest a slight rephrase to make it more idiomatic and easier to understand. Instead of ""Anson believed himself to be handsome,"" you could say ""Anson thought he was handsome."" This is a more common way to express the idea, and it flows better.
      "	". So, the correct version of your sentence would be: Anson thought he was handsome.
"
0	". The first mistake is that ""about"" should be written as ""approximately"". In English, we use ""approximately"" to indicate a rough estimate of time, whereas ""about"" can have other meanings such as ""concerning"" or ""near"". So the corrected sentence would be: We arrived approximately six o'clock.
      "	". The second mistake is that ""1"" should not be written in words. Instead, it should be written as a number: We arrived at 6:00.
      "
1	". The word ""having"" is not necessary in this context, as the verb ""fought"" already implies that Gilgamesh has engaged in the action of fighting the dragon. So, you could simplify the sentence to ""Gilgamesh fought the dragon.""
      "	". Here's the correct version of your sentence: Gilgamesh fought the dragon.
"
1	". There are a few potential issues with your sentence that could be improved upon. Firstly, it would be more idiomatic to say ""Anson thought himself happy"" instead of ""Anson thought that himself was happy."" This is because the word ""that"" is not needed in this context, and using ""himself"" as a object pronoun instead of ""he"" makes the sentence sound more natural.
      "	". Additionally, it would be helpful to add an auxiliary verb (""do"") to make the sentence grammatically complete. For example: Anson thought himself happy doing [insert activity here]. This way,

      "
0	". The first mistake is that ""I might be not going"" should be ""I might not go."" The word ""not"" should be moved to the end of the phrase for correct syntax. Additionally, ""washing my hair"" is a separate clause and should be set off with a comma after ""going.""
      "	". Here's the corrected sentence: I might not go to the party, but I will wash my hair.
      "
0	". The word ""myself"" is not necessary in this context, as it is already implied by the use of the first person pronoun ""I."" So, the sentence could be simplified to ""I thought he liked me.""

"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it stands.
      "	". The butler sent the poison to Dinah. (No changes needed.)
"
0	". The first error is that ""to seem"" should be ""seeming,"" as it modifies the verb ""appear."" Additionally, ""happen to appear"" is a bit awkward and could be rephrased as ""Jason appears to be sick."" Finally, there should be a comma after ""sick"" to separate the two independent clauses.
      "	". Here's the corrected sentence: Jason seems to be sick.

         • Missing article ""the"" before ""strict grammar mistakes""

"
0	". The first mistake is that ""We linguists"" should be ""Linguists we,"" as the subject-verb agreement rule states that when there is a plural subject, the verb must also be in the plural form. Additionally, the word order of the sentence should be reversed to make it more clear and concise. So instead of ""We linguists love to argue,"" it should be ""Linguists we love to argue.""
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: Linguists we love to argue.

      "	". Here's the correct version of your sentence: Which king did you ask which city was invaded?
      "
0	". The first mistake is that ""It"" should be capitalized because it is a pronoun referring to a noun (in this case, humans). Additionally, ""disgruntled"" should be an adjective describing the pigs, not a verb. Finally, ""those ditches"" should be pluralized correctly as ""these ditches.""
      "	". Here's the corrected sentence: It is some disgruntled old pigs in these ditches that humans love to eat.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it is written.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: ""That banana is being eaten by the monkey."" This version uses the correct verb tense and word order to convey the intended meaning.
"
1	". None.
      "	". If you meant to express anger or frustration, it would be more appropriate to use a less confrontational phrase such as ""I'm really upset with them"" or ""I need to address this issue."" Using ""Burn them!"" can come across as threatening and is not an effective way to communicate your feelings.
      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is: It stinks that Aphrodite is all-powerful.

"
1	". There are a few minor issues with word choice and phrasing that could be improved to make the sentence more clear and natural-sounding. Specifically, ""maniac"" is not the most precise or common term for someone who is mentally ill or unstable; it can come across as somewhat derogatory or sensationalistic. Additionally, the phrase ""seems to be"" could be simplified to just ""is.""
      "	". Here's a revised version of your sentence that addresses these issues: Agamemnon appears to have mental health challenges. This wording is more neutral and accurate, and it avoids

      "	". Here's a suggested revision to make your sentence more concise and clear: ""I wondered who Medea had poisoned."" This version uses the active voice, making it easier to understand who performed the action of poisoning.
"
0	". The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. ""I"" is a singular pronoun and should agree with a singular verb form. Instead of ""could we leave,"" it should be ""can/could I leave."" Additionally, the word order is not ideal. It would sound more natural to say ""When could I leave?""
      "	". The correct version of your sentence: When could I leave?
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is ""They kicked them.""
"
1	". The verb tense in your sentence is inconsistent. You have used the past simple ""ate"" for the monkey, but the present perfect ""has eaten"" for the banana. To fix this, you could change either the verb or the subject to maintain a consistent tense throughout the sentence.
      "	". Here's a corrected version of your sentence: The monkey has eaten the banana. This is more grammatically correct and natural-sounding.
"
0	". The first mistake is that ""I would like to could"" should be ""I would like to can."" ""Could"" is an auxiliary verb used for possibility and ability, but it's not the correct choice here because you're expressing a desire or intention. Additionally, there should be no space between ""like"" and ""to.""
      "	". The corrected sentence would be: I would like to can swim 1.
      "
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it is.

      "	". Here are some possible revisions:
          - The bookcase moved (this is the most idiomatic revision)
          - The bookcase was moving (this is also grammatically correct, but less common than ""m
"
1	". There are no grammar mistakes in your sentence. However, some people might find it more common and natural to say ""I shaved"" instead of ""I shaved myself,"" as the verb ""shave"" is typically used in the third person singular (e.g., ""She shaved her beard"").
      "	". The correct version of your sentence would be: I shaved my face/body. This is a more common and natural way to phrase it, as ""I shaved myself"" can sound a bit awkward or formal in some contexts.
"
1	". None. Your sentence is grammatically correct as it is.
      "	". The correct version of the sentence is ""Anson became muscle-bound."" (Note that ""muscle-bound"" is one word, not two.)"
