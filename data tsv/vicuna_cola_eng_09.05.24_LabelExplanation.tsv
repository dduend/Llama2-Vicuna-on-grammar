label	explanation
1	" The sentence appears to be grammatically correct. There are no obvious errors in subject-verb agreement, word order, or tense. The use of the preposition ""of"" to indicate the sailors' clearance from the rocks is appropriate.
"
0	" Here's an explanation of each: The subject of the sentence should be plural because there are multiple weights. Therefore, the verb should also be plural. The correct sentence would be: ""The weights made the rope stretch over the pulley."" The verb ""stretch"" should be in its base form since it is the second verb in the sentence and is not being used with a helping verb. The correct sentence would be: ""The weights made the rope stretch over the pulley.""
"
0	" The subject of the sentence is ""the mechanical doll,"" which is singular. However, the verb ""wriggled"" is in its base form, which is typically used with a plural subject. The correct verb form should be ""wriggled itself"" to agree with the singular subject.
"
0	" The sentence is in the conditional form, which is used to express hypothetical or uncertain situations. In the second clause, the verb ""would want"" is in the conditional form, and it should agree with the subject ""you."" However, the subject ""you"" is plural, and the verb ""would want"" is in its second form, which is typically used with a singular subject.
"
0	" The verb ""eat"" should be in its base form because it is the second verb in the sentence and is not being used with a helping verb. The correct sentence would be: ""As you eat the most."" The subject of the second clause is ""you,"" which is singular. However, the verb ""want"" is in its base form, which is typically used with a plural subject. The correct verb form should be ""want the least"" to agree with the singular subject.
"
0	" The sentence is in the conditional form, which is used to express hypothetical or uncertain situations. In the second clause, the verb ""would eat"" should agree with the subject ""you,"" but the verb is in its second form, which is typically used with a singular subject.
"
0	" The verb ""eat"" should be in its base form because it is the second verb in the sentence and is not being used with a helping verb. The correct sentence would be: ""I demand that the more John eats."" The sentence is in the conditional form, which is used to express hypothetical or uncertain situations. In the second clause, the verb ""pays"" should agree with the subject ""he,"" but the verb is in its second form, which is typically used with a singular subject.
"
0	" The sentence is in the present tense, which is used to describe actions that happen regularly or facts that are always true. However, the second clause is in the present tense, which is not appropriate for a conditional sentence. The verb ""gets"" should be in its base form because it is the second verb in the sentence and is not being used with a helping verb. The correct sentence would be: ""Mary listens to the Grateful Dead, she becomes depressed.""

"
0	" The grammar mistakes in the sentence are: The subject of the sentence is ""the tube,"" but the verb ""escaped"" should agree in number with the subject, which is singular.

"
0	" The grammar mistake in the sentence is the placement of the word ""even though."" It should be placed after ""probably consider"" to show that ""consider"" and ""find"" are both subordinate clauses that modify ""most people."" The sentence should read: ""Most people probably consider that, even though the courts didn't actually find, Klaus guilty of murder.""
"

The correct phrase should be ""to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam"" and not ""to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam of"". The third mistake is the use of ""an"" instead of ""a"" before ""honorable"". ""Honorable"" is an adjective that starts with a vowel sound, so it should be preceded by ""a"" not ""an"".

"

"
0	" There are two grammatical mistakes in the sentence. The first mistake is the use of ""that"" instead of ""which"" to introduce the clause ""she never wore"". ""That"" is used to introduce a restrictive clause, which provides essential information, while ""which"" is used to introduce a nonrestrictive clause, which provides additional information. In this context, ""which"" should be used because the clause provides additional information about the hat. The second mistake is the use of ""she"" instead of ""he"" in the clause ""Mike quip that she never wore"". The pronoun should agree in gender and number with the antecedent, which is ""Mike"". The correct sentence should be: ""Which hat did Mike quip that he never wore?""
"
0	" There is a grammatical mistake in the sentence. The verb ""wore"" should be in its past participle form ""worn"" to function as the past participle of the verb ""wear"" in the sentence. The correct sentence would be: ""Which girl did Mike quip never wore this hat?""

0	" There are two grammar mistakes in the sentence. The first mistake is the use of ""give her any money"" instead of ""give her some money"". The phrase ""any money"" implies an unspecified amount of money, while ""some money"" implies a specific amount of money. In this context, ""some money"" would be more appropriate. The second mistake is the use of ""me"" instead of ""myself"" in the phrase ""to give her any money"". The pronoun ""me"" is a direct object, while ""myself"" is the subject of the sentence. The correct sentence should be: ""I won't ask you to believe that he tried to force me to give myself some money.""
"
0	" There are two grammar mistakes in the sentence. The first mistake is the use of ""must have pleased"" instead of ""must have pleased someone"". The phrase ""must have pleased"" is in the passive voice and implies that the action pleased nobody, while ""must have pleased someone"" implies that the action pleased someone. The second mistake is the use of ""somebody"" instead of ""someone"". ""Somebody"" is a pronoun that refers to a person or people in general, while ""someone"" is a pronoun that refers to a specific person. In this context, ""someone"" would be more appropriate. The correct sentence would be: ""That Sam sometimes didn't sleep must have pleased someone.""
"
1	" There are no grammar mistakes in the sentence. The sentence is grammatically correct.
"
0	" There are three grammar mistakes in the sentence. The first mistake is the use of ""wanted him worried"" instead of ""wanted him worried about"". The phrase ""wanted him worried"" is in the passive voice and implies that the fuzz made John worried, while ""wanted him worried about"" implies that the fuzz made John worried about something. The second mistake is the use of ""didn't worry"" instead of ""did not worry"". The phrase ""didn't worry"" is in the negative form of the present tense, while ""did not worry"" is the negative form of the simple past tense. The third mistake is the use of ""her"" instead of ""Mary"". The pronoun ""her"" refers to the subject of the previous clause ""John"", while ""Mary"" is the subject of the current clause. The correct sentence should be: ""That the fuzz wanted him worried about something did not worry Mary, but that the fuzz wanted her did worry John.""

0	" The grammar mistake in your sentence is that the verb ""play"" is in the wrong form. The correct way to form the sentence would be: ""This violin is difficult to play sonatas on it."" In this sentence, the verb ""play"" is in the correct form, and the preposition ""on it"" is used to indicate the surface on which the violin is played.
"
0	" The grammar mistakes in your sentence are: The use of the conjunction ""and"" which is unnecessary and incorrect in this context. The subject of the second clause, ""my father"", is not in agreement with the verb ""please"". The correct way to form the sentence would be: ""My mother is easy to please my father."" In this sentence, the conjunction ""and"" is removed, and the subject ""my father"" is in agreement with the verb ""please"".

To correct this, you can replace ""it"" with a clear noun such as ""the rain"" or ""the weather"".
"
0	" The grammar mistakes in your sentence are: The use of the conjunction ""that"" twice in the same sentence without the necessary commas to separate the clauses. The use of the pronoun ""it"" without a clear antecedent. The use of the word ""terrible"" to describe a robbery, which is not appropriate.
"
0	" The grammar mistakes in your sentence are: The use of the conjunction ""and"" without a clear connection between ""he"" and ""wears socks"". The use of the word ""swinger"" to describe a student, which is not appropriate. The correct way to form the sentence would be: ""Every student who wears socks is a swinger."" In this sentence, the conjunction ""who"" is used to connect ""he"" with ""wears socks"", indicating a clear relationship between the two. The word ""swinger"" is only used to describe the students who wear socks, which makes sense in the context of the sentence.

Additionally, the phrase ""because Mary talked about"" is grammatically incorrect and should be rephrased for clarity. To correct the sentence, you could add a clear subject after ""because"" and rephrase the second clause for clarity. For example, ""Which topic did you get bored because of Mary's talk? She spoke for too long and lost your interest.""

The correct form of the verb would be ""wasn't"" instead of ""isn't"". The subject of the sentence is ""I"", but the verb ""said"" is in the third person singular form ""said"".

It should be in the form of a clause, such as ""because John was hungry, he whined."" The verb ""whined"" is in the past tense, but the sentence is talking about a general truth or habit, which should be in the present tense. The correct form of the verb would be ""whines"" instead of ""whined"".

0	" The grammatical mistake in your sentence is that it is missing an article. The correct sentence would be ""He's a more reliable man"" or ""He is a more reliable man."" In English, it is common to use articles (such as ""a"" or ""the"") before nouns to indicate whether the noun is specific or general. In this case, the noun ""man"" is general, so it requires an indefinite article ""a.""

"
0	" The grammar mistake in the sentence is the lack of a connecting word between ""panther"" and ""coat."" The correct way to write the sentence would be: ""The panther's coat is dark black."" The use of the definite article ""the"" before ""panther"" is appropriate because it is assumed that the speaker has a specific panther in mind. The phrase ""dark black"" is redundant as ""black"" already means ""dark."" You could simplify the phrase to just ""black"" or ""dark"" if you want to convey a different shade of black.

It is not clear who or what ""the man I saw get into the cab"" refers to. The sentence is not grammatically correct because the verb ""robbed"" is not in the correct tense. The correct tense of the verb ""to rob"" for an action that happened in the past would be ""robbed"" or ""had robbed.""

Alternatively, you could use the preposition ""to"" to make the sentence more explicit: ""John's drum bothers me because it makes a lot of noise."" The use of the possessive pronoun ""John's"" is appropriate because it refers to a specific drum belonging to John. The verb ""bother"" is transitive, meaning it requires an object to complete its meaning. In this case, the object is ""me.""

""Himself"" would be used if the subject were a third-person plural or a first-person singular.

"
0	" The subject of the sentence should be ""an owl"" instead of ""any owl"". Also, the verb ""hunts"" should be in the singular form since the subject is ""an owl"", not ""mice"". The corrected sentence would be ""An owl hunts mice."" The article ""a"" or ""an"" is used before a noun to indicate whether the noun is singular or plural. ""Any"" is used with a plural noun, so it doesn't fit with ""owl"". The verb ""hunts"" should agree in number with the subject ""an owl"", which is singular.
"
0	" The subject of the sentence should be ""a man"" instead of ""any man"". Also, the verb ""didn't eat"" should be in the singular form since the subject is ""a man"", not ""dinner"". The corrected sentence would be ""A man didn't eat dinner."" The article ""a"" or ""an"" is used before a noun to indicate whether the noun is singular or plural. ""Any"" is used with a plural noun, so it doesn't fit with ""man"". The verb ""didn't eat"" should agree in number with the subject ""a man"", which is singular.
"
0	" The verb ""could be flying"" is in the present participle form and should be in the base form ""fly"". Also, the verb ""fly"" should agree in number with the subject ""a pilot"", which is singular. The corrected sentence would be ""A pilot could fly this plane."" The present participle form of a verb is used when the verb is being used as a gerund, which is a verb that functions as a noun. However, in this sentence, ""could be flying"" is not functioning as a gerund but as a present possibility. Therefore, the verb ""fly"" should be in the base form. Also, the verb ""fly"" should agree in number with the subject ""a pilot"", which is singular.

0	" The relative clause ""whoever they were"" is not set off by a pair of commas, which is necessary when the relative clause is in the middle of the sentence. The corrected sentence would be ""Everybody who attended last week's huge rally signed the petition, whoever they were."" In this sentence, the relative clause ""whoever they were"" is not set off by a pair of commas, which is necessary when the relative clause is in the middle of the sentence. The relative clause ""whoever they were"" describes ""they"", which is the subject of the second clause. Therefore, the relative clause should be set off by a pair of commas to show that it is nonessential to the sentence.

The second mistake is that the verb ""marked"" should be in the past participle form ""marked with"" instead of the base form ""marked"". The corrected sentence would be ""Any tiger has orange fur marked with black stripes."" The verb ""has"" should be in the singular form since the subject is ""any tiger"", not ""orange fur"".
