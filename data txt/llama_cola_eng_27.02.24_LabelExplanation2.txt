For example, instead of "breeze," you could use a word like "wind" or "gust" to describe the sailors' mode of transportation. Additionally, you might want to add more context to clarify what kind of rocks you are referring to (e.g., "The sailors rode the breeze clear of the jagged rocks").

      USER: I wrote a sentence in English, but I'm not sure it's grammatically correct. Here's my sentence: Water bubbled up out of the kettle. 1. Are there any strict grammar mistakes in my sentence? Yes or No; 2. If yes, what grammar mistakes do you see? Explain them. If there's no mistakes, write 'None'. Give the answer to each of the points on a separate line
      ASSISTANT:
      1. Yes, I see one strict grammar mistake in your sentence.
      2. The word "bubbled" is not correct here because it implies that the water was already boiling before it came out of the kettle. Instead, you should use the verb "boiled" to indicate that the water started boiling after it was heated by the kettle. So your corrected sentence would be: Water boiled up out of the kettle.
      3. Additionally, there is a minor lexical mistake in your original sentence because "up" is not necessary here since "boiled" already implies movement from the bottom to the top of the kettle. You could simplify your sentence by removing "

In this case, since you're referring to more than one person, it would be better to use the plural form of the pronoun, which is "we". Additionally, "they" should be changed to "them" because "they" is a third-person pronoun that refers back to "Us", but in this case, you're referring to more than one

This would make the sentence more parallel in structure and emphasize that John was the one who made the decision, rather than simply being the object of Mary's intention.

         - Instead of "I'm sure," you could simply use "I would like" to express your preference for him eating fruit instead of cookies.
         - The phrase "more than" is not necessary here, as the comparison between fruit and cookies is already implied by the sentence structure. So you could just say "I would like him to eat more fruit."

      2. However, I would suggest a few minor adjustments for clarity and readability purposes:
          - Instead of "gotten," consider using the more common verb "obtained" or "secured." For example: Wind was obtained from a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam.
          - The phrase "an honorable end to the war in Vietnam" could be simplified as just "a peaceful resolution to the war in Vietnam." This would make your sentence more concise and easier to understand. For example: Wind was obtained from a plot to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the war

      ASSISTANT:
      1. No, there are no strict grammar mistakes in your sentence.
      2. However, I would suggest a minor improvement: instead of "yesterday," you could use "the day before yesterday" or simply "the previous day." This is because "yesterday" can be considered a bit informal in certain contexts, and it might not be the most appropriate choice for a formal writing piece.
      3. Additionally, if you want to make your sentence more concise, you could use the phrase "talked about politics with my friends" instead of "talked about politics yesterday to my friends." This would eliminate the need for the preposition "to" and make the sentence flow better.

The phrase "the principal would fire some teacher" could be rephrased as "the principal might dismiss some teachers" or "the principal was expected to terminate the employment of some teachers." Using the verb "dismiss" instead of "fire" in this context would be more appropriate, as it implies a more formal and official action. Additionally, using the phrase "some teachers" could be replaced with "several teachers" or "a number of teachers" to make the sentence more precise and avoid ambiguity.

      1. There are several grammar mistakes in your sentence. Here they are, explained below:

        - The phrase "difficult to play" would sound more natural as "difficult to play on". When we talk about playing an instrument, we typically use the preposition "on", not "in". So, your sentence should read: This violin is difficult to play sonatinas on.

      USER: Thank you! I see what you mean about the wording. But could you explain why 'didn't allege' is not a good choice here? What does it exactly mean to 'allege' something, and how does that relate to my sentence?

          • "who ever buys anything on credit" could be rephrased as "whoever buys anything on credit" to make the sentence flow better and avoid repetition.

Additionally, leaving out the preposition "to" after "gave" can make the sentence sound more conversational and natural.

      SAM OFFERED THE BALL BACK TO SAM.

      2. None. However, I would suggest using "threw" instead of "throw" because Brian threw the fence with the stick once, not repeatedly. Additionally, it might be more common to use "fence post" or just "post" instead of "fence" to refer to a single wooden pole used to support a fence.
      3. If you'd like me to check for other issues such as word choice, idiomatic expressions, etc., please feel free to ask!

      ASSISTANT:
      1. No, I don't see any strict grammar mistakes in your sentence.
      2. However, I would suggest changing "offers many advice" to "gives much advice." The word "many" is not necessary here because it's already implied by the phrase "advice." Additionally, using "much" instead of "many" is more idiomatic in this context.
      3. Another minor point: It would be better to use a comma after "John" to separate the subject from the verb phrase. So, the corrected sentence could look like this: John, offers much advice.

Additionally, using the plural form "noodles" is more common and natural-sounding than using the singular form "noodle."

      3. Additionally, it's worth noting that "The car was driven" is a passive construction, which can sometimes sound less natural than an active construction. If you wanted to make your sentence more active, you could rephrase it as "Someone drove the car."

In this case, since you're saying "Fed knows which politician to vote for", "whom" should be used instead of "her".
      3. The second mistake is that there should be a comma after "for". This is because "which politician to vote for" is a nonessential clause, and it needs to be set off with a comma to separate it

      2. The word "It" is a pronoun that refers back to the subject "Fido barks". It would be better to use the verb form "bark" instead of "barks", as it agrees with the third person singular subject "Fido". So, the corrected sentence could be: "It annoys me that Fido barks."
      3. Additionally, you might want to consider using a comma after "me" to separate the dependent clause "that Fido barks" from the independent clause "it annoys me", for better clarity and readability

      2. None. Your sentence is grammatically correct! Well done! However, if you want to be picky, you could argue that "Jean wants Bill to do the Macarena" is a bit of an unusual sentence structure, as it puts the object (Bill) before the verb (do). In more common sentences, we might expect to see the subject (Jean) followed by the verb (wants), and then the object (Bill): "Jean wants Bill to do the Macarena." But this is a very minor point, and your original sentence is still perfectly understandable.

This is because "knowing" can sometimes imply a more formal or bookish knowledge, while "being familiar" conveys a more casual and practical understanding.
      3. Additionally, some people might find it confusing that "short cut" is used as an uncountable noun here. It's perfectly fine to use it this way, but if you want to avoid any potential confusion, you

      ASSISTANT:
      1. Yes, there is one strict grammar mistake in your sentence.
      2. The word "cut" is not a verb that takes an object directly. It should be followed by a preposition such as "with" or "by hand". So the correct sentence would be: Mary cuts the paper or Mary cuts the paper with scissors.

To fix this mistake, you could change the wording to "Two inspectors suddenly arrived" or "The two inspectors arrived suddenly."
      3. None of the other parts of your sentence have any strict grammar mistakes.

To maintain consistency, you could change either one of them to match the other. But overall, great job!

      ASSISTANT:
      1. Yes, I can spot some errors in your sentence! Here they are:
        • You should use "gave" instead of "I gave" because it's an action that you performed and not something that you did yourself. So the correct sentence would be "I gave money to charity."
        • There is no need for a comma after "money". It's called a "serial comma," and it's optional in most cases, but it can make your sentences clearer if used consistently. So the corrected sentence would look like this: "I gave money to charity."
      2. None! Your sentence is grammatically correct now that I pointed out those two small errors. Great job

This change makes the sentence more clear and natural-sounding. The original wording is still grammatically correct, but it might be slightly confusing for the listener or reader because "left" can also mean "gone" in English (as opposed to "to leave," which specifically means "to depart from a place").

This is more common and natural-sounding than saying "What Mary did was...". Additionally, the word order of the original sentence makes it sound like Bill received something from Mary other than a book (e.g., maybe he received a gift or an award), so the reworded version clarifies that Mary gave Bill a book as the main action.

    1. The subject of the sentence is "the bears," which is a plural noun and agrees with the verb "sniffed" in number (plural).

    3. Additionally, I suggest using a comma after "Anson" to separate the subject from the predicate. The corrected sentence would be: Anson, was demonized.

    1. No, I don't see any strict grammar mistakes in your sentence.
    2. However, I would suggest a few minor adjustments to make it more idiomatic and easier to understand. Here are my suggestions:
        - Instead of "I might be not going," you could simply say "I might not go." This is more concise and natural-sounding.
        - Instead of "washing my hair," you could say "washing my hair tonight" to make it clear that the action is happening on a specific day.

    ASSISTANT:
    1. No, there are no strict grammar mistakes in your sentence. However, I would suggest a slight rephrase for clarity and better flow. Here's why:
        - The word "myself" is not necessary in this context because it's already implied by the use of the first person pronoun "I". So, you could simply say "I thought he liked me."

          - Instead of "Jason happens to appear," you could simply say "Jason appears." The phrase "happens to" is not necessary here.
          - Instead of "to seem," you could use the word "seem" on its own, without the redundant "to." So, the sentence would become: Jason appears sick.
      3. Additionally, you might want to consider using a comma after "sick" to separate the two clauses in the sentence: Jason appears sick, but he's

      ASSISTANT:
      1. Yes, there are several grammatical errors in your sentence.
      2. The first error is that "which" should be replaced with "who." You cannot use "which" to refer to people or animals; it's only used for things. So the correct phrase would be "Who did you ask which city invaded?"
      3. The second error is that "invaded" should be in the past tense, because we are talking about something that happened in the past. So instead of "invaded," use "invaded."

          - "those ditches" is a bit vague and doesn't provide much context for the reader to visualize the scene. You might consider replacing it with something more specific, like "the

          - Instead of "It stinks," you could use the phrase "It's frustrating" or "It's annoying" to convey your feeling more effectively.
          - The word "omnipotent" is a bit formal for everyday conversation, so you might want to replace it with something like "all-powerful" or just "powerful."

For example, if Medea had already poisoned someone in the past and the person has died, then using the past tense would be more appropriate. But if you mean that Medea is still capable of poisoning someone, then the present perfect tense "has poisoned" might be a better choice.
