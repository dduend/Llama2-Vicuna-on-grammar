The correct form should be "whoever," as it is an example of a pronoun used to refer to anyone who buys something on credit, regardless of their identity or background. Additionally, you might consider adding a comma after "here" in order to separate the two independent clauses within your sentence more effectively.
      3. Here's a possible revision of your sentence that incorporates these suggestions: Everybody around here whoever buys anything

This version uses more formal language and avoids the use of contractions (like "was" instead of "were").

      ASSISTANT:
      1. There are a few potential issues with your sentence. The main one is that "lifted" should be in the past tense to match the action being described (the books were lifted, not lift). Additionally, it would be more common to say "The books were placed on the table" rather than "The books lifted onto the table."
      2. Yes, there are strict grammar mistakes in your sentence. The main mistake is using the present tense of the verb "lifted" instead of the past tense. Additionally, the phrase "onto the table" is not necessary and can be omitted for a more concise sentence.

      2. There are a few minor issues with word choice and phrasing that could be improved upon, but no strict grammatical errors. For example, "loaded" is a bit of an awkward verb to use here, as it implies Jessica was physically lifting the boxes onto the wagon, when it might be more natural to say she "placed" or "put" them under the wagon instead. Additionally, "under the wagon" could be shortened to simply "beneath the wagon."

      2. The word "drive" is not necessary as packages cannot drive themselves. You could remove it and the sentence would still be grammatically correct. Additionally, "easily" is an adverb that modifies the verb "to New York," but it's not needed in this context either. So, your sentence could be simplified to: Packages go to New York.

      2. ...I would suggest a few minor adjustments to make it more idiomatic and easier to understand. Specifically, "recommend" is typically used as a verb, not a noun, so you might want to change the phrase "We recommend to eat less cake and pastry" to something like "We recommend eating less cake and pastry." Additionally, it's more common in English to use the word "less" instead of "fewer" when referring to food or other items that cannot be counted as individual units. So you could change "cake and pastry" to "cake

      USER: Hi! I wrote a sentence in English, but I'm not sure it's grammatically correct. Here's my sentence: I saw that gas can explode. 1. Are there any strict grammar mistakes in my sentence? Yes or No; 2. If yes, what grammar mistakes do you see? Explain them. If there's no mistakes, write 'None'; 3. What is the correct version of the sentence?
      ASSISTANT:

      2. There are a few suggestions that could improve the clarity and accuracy of your sentence:
         - Instead of "gas can explode," you might consider using "the gas can explosive." This phrase is more precise and avoids potential confusion with other types of gases that cannot explode.
         - You may also want to add a verb after "I saw" to make the sentence more active and engaging. For example, "I saw that the gas can was explosive" or "I noticed that the gas can had the potential to explode."

      USER: Hi! I wrote a sentence in English, but I'm not sure it's grammatically correct. Here's my sentence: Kim put in the box. 1. Are there any strict grammar mistakes in my sentence? Yes or No; 2. If yes, what grammar mistakes do you see? Explain them. If there's no mistakes, write 'None'; 3. What is the correct version of the sentence?
      ASSISTANT:
      1. Yes, there are strict grammar mistakes in your sentence.
      2. The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. "Kim" is a singular noun, but "put" is a plural verb. It should be changed to "puts". Additionally, the preposition "in" doesn't match with the object "box". A more appropriate preposition would be "into".
      3. The correct version of your sentence would be: Kim puts into the box.

      ASSISTANT:
      1. There are a few potential issues with your sentence:
        - The subject-verb agreement is off. "Neither" is singular, so it should be paired with a singular verb. Instead of "failed," you could use "has failed."
        - You've used the word "of" incorrectly. It doesn't make sense in this context because "students" is already plural. Instead, you could just say "neither of the students."

          a. Neither has failed. (Corrected subject-verb agreement)

          - The phrase "in the doorway" is a bit redundant, as "doorway" already implies that someone is inside or near it. You could simplify the sentence by removing this phrase and just saying "The boy waved to his father."

          - Check if you meant to use "Kim" instead of "John" as the subject of the sentence, since "John" is not a suitable name for a person. If this is a typo, you can correct it accordingly.

      ASSISTANT:
      1. There are several grammatical errors in your sentence. The verb tense is inconsistent and the subject-verb agreement is incorrect. Here are the specific errors I see:
          - The verb "be" should be in the present tense to match the rest of the sentence, which is written in the present tense. Instead, you used the past tense form "was."
          - The subject of the sentence is "the child," which is a singular noun and should agree with the singular verb "is" instead of the plural verb "be."
      2. Here are the corrected sentences:
          - Did the child attend school? (corrected to present tense)

          b) The word "not" is unnecessary and can usually be omitted.
          c) The phrase "the town" should be set off with commas to indicate that it is a nonrestrictive (i.e., parenthetical) clause.

          - Use "whom" instead of "her" as the object of the verb "vote for." This is because "her" is an indirect object, while "whom" is the objective form of "who." So, the correct phrase would be "Fed knows whom to vote for."
          - Consider adding a comma after "for" to separate the two clauses in your sentence. This will help make it clearer that you are describing two distinct actions: Fed knowing who to vote for and Fed actually voting for that

      USER: Hi! I wrote a sentence in English, but I'm not sure it's grammatically correct. Here's my sentence: He left the train with somebody else's wallet in his pocket. 1. Are there any strict grammar mistakes in my sentence? Yes or No; 2. If yes, what grammar mistakes do you see? Explain them. If there's no mistakes, write 'None'; 3. What is the correct version of the sentence?
      ASSISTANT:
      1. No, I don't see any strict grammar mistakes in your sentence.
      2. There are a few minor issues that you could improve on to make it even more clear and effective:
          - "with somebody else's wallet" is a bit wordy; you might consider using "someone else's wallet" instead, which is more concise.
          - The phrase "in his pocket" is implied by the fact that he left with the wallet, so it's not necessary to include it explicitly.
      3. Here's a revised version of your sentence: He left the train with someone else's wallet.

      ASSISTANT:
      1. Yes, there are several grammatical errors in your sentence.
      2. The first error is that "The book" should be "The books," as you need to use a plural form because you're referring to more than one book. Additionally, the word order of the sentence should be reversed so that the adjective comes before the noun it modifies. So instead of saying "The book is boring," you should say "Boring is the book."

      ASSISTANT:
      1. Yes, there are strict grammar mistakes in your sentence.
      2. The first mistake is that "It was from six to nine" should be "It took place from six to nine." This is because "it was" is a past tense verb form and does not fit well with the phrase "from six to nine," which implies a duration of time rather than an event happening at a specific point in the past. Additionally, using "took place" instead of "was" makes the sentence more formal and precise.
      3. The correct version of your sentence would be: It took place from six to nine.

      2. The phrase "from the INS" can be shortened to just "from the INS."

Additionally, you could replace "arrived" with "showed up" or "appeared" to make the sentence more conversational.

      USER: Hi! I wrote a sentence in English, but I'm not sure it's grammatically correct. Here's my sentence: I thought he liked myself 1. Are there any strict grammar mistakes in my sentence? Yes or No; 2. If yes, what grammar mistakes do you see? Explain them. If there's no mistakes, write 'None'; 3. What is the correct version of the sentence?
      ASSISTANT:
      1. No, I don't see any strict grammar mistakes in your sentence. However, there is a slight awkwardness in the phrasing that could be improved.
      2. The word "myself" is not necessary in this context, as it is already implied by the use of the first person pronoun "I." So, the sentence could be simplified to "I thought he liked me."
      3. Here's the correct version of your sentence: I thought he liked me.

Are there any strict grammar mistakes in my sentence? Yes or No; 2. If yes, what grammar mistakes do you see? Explain them. If there's no mistakes, write 'None'; 3. What is the correct version of the sentence?
      ASSISTANT:
      1. Yes, there are several grammatical errors in your sentence.
      2. The first error is that "to seem" should be "seeming," as it modifies the verb "appear." Additionally, "happen to appear" is a bit awkward and could be rephrased as "Jason appears to be sick." Finally, there should be a comma after "sick" to separate the two independent clauses.
      3. Here's the corrected sentence: Jason seems to be sick.

Yes or No; 2. If yes, what grammar mistakes do you see? Explain them. If there's no mistakes, write 'None'; 3. What is the correct version of the sentence?
      ASSISTANT:
      1. There are a few potential issues with your sentence:
      
          - The phrase "What did you ask" should be "Who did you ask," as "ask" is not a verb that can take an object directly. Instead, it needs to be followed by a preposition like "about." 
          - There should be a comma after "who" to separate the clause from the rest of the sentence.  
      2. Here are the grammar mistakes I see:
         • Missing article "the" before "strict grammar mistakes"
         • Incorrect use of "ask" as a verb 
          - The correct version should be "Who did you ask about?" with no commas.

Yes or No; 2. If yes, what grammar mistakes do you see? Explain them. If there's no mistakes, write 'None'; 3. What is the correct version of the sentence?
      ASSISTANT:
      1. There are a few strict grammar mistakes in your sentence. Yes.
      2. The first mistake is that "We linguists" should be "Linguists we," as the subject-verb agreement rule states that when there is a plural subject, the verb must also be in the plural form. Additionally, the word order of the sentence should be reversed to make it more clear and concise. So instead of "We linguists love to argue," it should be "Linguists we love to argue."
      3. The correct version of your sentence would be: Linguists we love to argue.

      ASSISTANT:
      1. Yes, there are several grammar mistakes in your sentence.
      2. The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. "Which king" is singular, but "did you ask" is plural. Additionally, "invaded" should be in the past tense to match the verb "asked".

      ASSISTANT:
      1. Yes, there are some strict grammar mistakes in your sentence.
      2. The first mistake is that "It" should be capitalized because it is a pronoun referring to a noun (in this case, humans). Additionally, "disgruntled" should be an adjective describing the pigs, not a verb. Finally, "those ditches" should be pluralized correctly as "these ditches."

      ASSISTANT:
      1. No, I don't see any strict grammar mistakes in your sentence. However, it's important to note that "Burn them!" is not a grammatically correct sentence and could be considered offensive or violent. It's better to avoid using language that may be perceived as hurtful or aggressive.
      2. None.
      3. If you meant to express anger or frustration, it would be more appropriate to use a less confrontational phrase such as "I'm really upset with them" or "I need to address this issue." Using "Burn them!" can come across as threatening and is not an effective way to communicate your feelings.

Specifically, "maniac" is not the most precise or common term for someone who is mentally ill or unstable; it can come across as somewhat derogatory or sensationalistic. Additionally, the phrase "seems to be" could be simplified to just "is."

"Could" is an auxiliary verb used for possibility and ability, but it's not the correct choice here because you're expressing a desire or intention. Additionally, there should be no space between "like" and "to."
