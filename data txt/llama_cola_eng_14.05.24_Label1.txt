     Yes, there is a mistake in your sentence. The correct phrase should be "Mary talked about him before Rusty talked about himself."

    USER: Are there any strict grammar mistakes in my sentence 'The books lifted onto the table.'? Answer like 'Yes' or 'No'
    ASSISTANT:
     Yes, there is one strict grammar mistake in your sentence "The books lifted onto the table." The verb tense is inconsistent. The verb "lifted" should be changed to a past participle form to match the present perfect tense of "have been". To correct this, you could say:
    USER: Ah, I see! Thank you for pointing that out. What would be the corrected sentence then?

     No, I don't see any strict grammar mistakes in your sentence "Jessica loaded boxes on the wagon." However, there is a possible error with verb tense consistency. The verb "loaded" is in the past tense, but the phrase "on the wagon" suggests that the action of loading is still ongoing. To avoid any confusion, you may want to change either the verb tense or the phrasing of the sentence to maintain consistent verb tense throughout.

    CORRECTED SENTENCE: Carla shoveled the snow. OR Carla is shoveling the walk.

    USER: Are there any strict grammar mistakes in my sentence 'He washed her.'? Answer like 'Yes' or 'No'
    ASSISTANT:
     I apologize for the confusion, but "He washed her" is not a grammatically correct sentence. The verb tense does not match and it lacks a subject-verb agreement. It should be "He washed her hands" to make it grammatically correct. So, the answer is 'Yes', there is a strict grammar mistake in your original sentence.

     No, there are no strict grammar mistakes in your sentence "The man I saw get into the cab robbed the bank." However, there is a possible error with verb tense consistency. The verb "get" is in the present participle form, which suggests that the action of getting into the cab is ongoing or continuous. However, the main verb "robbed" is in the simple past tense, which indicates a completed action. To maintain verb tense consistency, you might consider rephrasing the sentence to use either the present participle form throughout (e.g., "The man I saw getting into the cab robbed the bank.") or the simple past tense form throughout (e.

Firstly, it would be more appropriate to use the verb "eat" instead of "to eat" as "to eat" is an infinitive phrase and can make the sentence sound less natural. Additionally, you may want to consider adding a comma after "Andy" to separate the two independent clauses in the sentence. Finally, it would be more accurate to use the word "salmon-flavored" instead of "salmon flavored" as "salmon flavored" is not a commonly used phrase and can sound
