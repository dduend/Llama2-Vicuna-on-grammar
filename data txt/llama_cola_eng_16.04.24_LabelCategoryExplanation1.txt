    USER: I wrote a sentence in English, but I'm not sure if it's grammatically correct. Here's my sentence: The tube was escaped by gas. 1. Are there any grammar mistakes in my sentence? Yes or No; 2. If yes, what is the category of the mistake: syntax, morphology or semantics ? If there's no mistakes, write 'None'; 3. Explain the mistakes you see. If there's no mistakes, write 'None'
    ASSISTANT:
    1. Yes, there are grammar mistakes in your sentence.
    2. The category of the mistake is syntax.
    3. The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. "The tube" is a singular noun and should be followed by a singular verb form, such as "was". Additionally, "escaped" is not the correct word choice to describe the action of gas leaking from a tube. A more appropriate phrase would be "leaked out of."
    USER: Thank you for your help! I'll keep that in mind next time.

    ASSISTANT:
    1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence.

    3. The word "bubbled" should be changed to "bubbles" because it is a third person singular present tense verb and requires an -s ending to match the subject "water". Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: Water bubbles up out of the kettle.

    3. You have used two relative clauses with "which" in a single sentence, which is not grammatically correct. It should be either one or the other. For example: This is the book that Bob reviewed, and this is the one that Fred won't do it. Or, This is the book which Bob reviewed, but this is not the one that Fred will do it.
    4. Additionally, you have used "won't" instead of "will not". It should be "will not" to make it grammatically correct. So, the corrected sentence would be:

    4. Additionally, there is a missing article before "book," which should be included to make the sentence grammatically correct. So, it would be better to say "I know which book Mag has read" instead of "I know which book Mag read."

    1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence.
    2. The category of the mistake is syntax.
    3. In English, it is not grammatically correct to use "how" as an adjective to modify a noun (in this case, "Peter"). Instead, you should use an adverb such as "very" or "extremely" to describe the degree of sanity that Peter possesses. Therefore, your sentence should read: How sane is Peter? would become Is Peter very sane? or Is Peter extremely sane?

Nonrestrictive clauses are those that add extra information about the subject of the sentence but do not limit its meaning.

    3. In English, "pull" is an action verb that requires an object to receive the action. For example, you could say "We pulled the car," or "We pulled out the weeds." However, "free" does not typically function as a direct object for verbs like "pull." Instead, it would be more common to use an adjective like "free" to describe something that is already in a certain state. For example, you could say "The bird flew free," or "We felt free after finishing our work."

ASSISTANT: Of course, happy to help! Your sentence "I'm sure we even got these tickets!" is grammatically correct because it follows the standard subject-verb-object (SVO) word order in English sentences. The verb "got" agrees with the subject "we," and the adverb "even" modifies the verb "got." Additionally, the phrase "these tickets" functions as an object after the verb "got."

    USER: I wrote a sentence in English, but I'm not sure if it's grammatically correct. Here's my sentence: John became deadly afraid of flying. 1. Are there any grammar mistakes in my sentence? Yes or No; 2. If yes, what is the category of the mistake: syntax, morphology or semantics ? If there's no mistakes, write 'None'; 3. Explain the mistakes you see. If there's no mistakes, write 'None'
    ASSISTANT:
    1. No; 2. None; 3. Your sentence is grammatically correct! Well done! However, I would like to point out that "deadly" and "afraid" are somewhat redundant in this context, as "deadly" already implies a high level of danger or risk. So, you could consider using just one word to convey the same meaning. For example: John became terrified of flying.
USER: Thank you for your feedback! You're absolutely right and I appreciate your help. Is there anything else you can tell me about this sentence?
ASSISTANT: Yes, I noticed that "became" is a passive verb, which can sometimes make the sentence feel less
