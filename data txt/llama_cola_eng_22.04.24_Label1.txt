     Yes, there is a mistake in your sentence. The correct phrase should be "Mary talked about him before Rusty talked about himself."

    ASSISTANT:
     No, I don't see any strict grammar mistakes in your sentence "Jessica loaded boxes on the wagon." However, there is a slight issue with the word order. It would be more grammatically correct to say "Jessica loaded the boxes onto the wagon" instead of "Jessica loaded boxes on the wagon." The phrase "onto the wagon" is more idiomatic and clearer in meaning than "on the wagon". Additionally, it's worth noting that "loaded" is a transitive verb and requires an object, so you could say "Jessica loaded the boxes onto the wagon" instead of just "Jessica loaded boxes on the wagon."

    USER: Are there any strict grammar mistakes in my sentence 'did the policeman meet in the park?'? Answer like 'Yes' or 'No'
    ASSISTANT:
     I apologize for any confusion, but there is a grammatical error in your question. The correct phrase would be "Did the policeman meet IN the park?" rather than "did the policeman meet IN the park?" as "in" should be used instead of "on". Additionally, it would be more appropriate to use the word "meet" instead of "met" since it is in the present tense.
     So, to answer your question directly, there are two grammatical errors in your sentence:
     1. Incorrect preposition usage (should be "in" instead of "on")
     2. Incorrect verb tense (should use "meet" instead of "met")

    ASSISTANT:
     No, there are no strict grammar mistakes in your sentence "The man I saw get into the cab robbed the bank." However, there is a potential issue with verb tense consistency. The verb "get" is in the past tense, but the verb "robbed" is in the past participle form and implies a completed action. To maintain verb tense consistency, you might consider rephrasing the sentence to use only the past tense or to clarify the timing of the events. For example:
     * The man I saw get into the cab robbed the bank before he left.
     * The man I saw getting into the cab robbed the bank just before he drove away
