          - Plural form of "student" should be used to match the plural form of "socks".

      3. The word "for" should be changed to "to" because you are fixing the computer for Carol, but it sounds like you are fixing the computer to Carol. To fix something means to make it work properly or repair it, so in this case, you should use "to". Here's your corrected sentence: I will fix the computer to Carol.

      3. The word "valuable" should be an adjective before the noun it modifies, i.e., "a valuable collection of manuscripts". Currently, it is placed after the verb "loaned", which makes it sound like a noun phrase modifying the verb. To fix this mistake, you can move the word "valuable" to the beginning of the sentence and make it an adjective before "collection".

      USER: I wrote a sentence in English, but I'm not sure if it's grammatically correct. Here's my sentence: I saw Bill while you did so Mary. 1. Are there any grammar mistakes in my sentence?

If there's no mistakes, write 'None'
      ASSISTANT:
      1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence.
      2. The category of the mistake is syntax.
      3. The subject-verb agreement is incorrect. You wrote "I saw Bill while you did so Mary," but it should be "I saw Bill while you were doing so with Mary." The verb "did" does not agree with the subject "you" in number. To fix this, change "did" to "were" to make the sentence grammatically correct.
