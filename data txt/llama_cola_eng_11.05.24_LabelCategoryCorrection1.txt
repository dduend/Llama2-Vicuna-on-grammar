    4. (Optional) Here's an explanation of the correction: In the original sentence, "quip" is a verb meaning to make a clever or witty remark, but it doesn't fit well in this context. Instead, I suggested using the phrase "say" which better conveys the intended meaning. Additionally, I changed "she never wore" to "she never wore" to make the sentence more concise and natural-sounding.
