In your original sentence, there is no direct object pronoun or prepositional phrase indicating what Mickey is looking at, so the sentence sounds incomplete and grammatically incorrect. By adding "at" before "it," we can make the sentence more complete and grammatically correct.

      3. The correct version of the sentence should be "I shaped a loaf of bread."
      4. Here's why: In English, when we use the verb "shape," it typically takes an object that specifies what is being shaped. In your original sentence, there was no such object, which made the sentence incomplete and grammatically incorrect. Adding "of bread" as the object of the verb "shaped" makes the sentence complete and correct.

    USER: Thank you! I see now that I made a common error by leaving out the verb 'themselves'. Can you explain why this correction improves the sentence?

      4. (Optional) Here's why: In English, when we use the verb "whisper" alone, it implies that the speaker whispers something to someone. To make the sentence grammatically correct, we need to add a prepositional phrase "to someone" after "whispered".

      3. The correct version of the sentence should be: Susan whispered to Rachel.
      4. (Optional) Here's why: In English, when we use "whisper" as a verb, it typically takes an object pronoun or a noun phrase as its direct object, rather than just a name. So instead of "Susan whispered at Rachel," which is grammatically correct but sounds a bit awkward, we can say "Susan whispered to Rachel" to make the sentence sound more natural and idiomatic.

      ASSISTANT: Sure, I'd be happy to help! In your original sentence, "put" is a verb that requires an object in the prepositional phrase "in the box." The word "the" before "box" is unnecessary and can be removed. Additionally, "book" should be changed to "into" because it is being placed inside the box, not

Without "in," the sentence could be interpreted as John being the office itself, rather than someone who was found in the office.
      5. Additionally, it's worth noting that the word "found" can also have a connotation of discovery or revelation

      4. Here's why: In English, we use the preposition "from" to indicate the starting point and the ending point of an activity or event. In your original sentence, you used "it was from" which is not grammatically incorrect but it sounds a bit awkward. Additionally, you need to specify what took place between six to nine, otherwise it's unclear what happened during that time frame.
