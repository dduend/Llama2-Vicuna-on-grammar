    ASSISTANT:
     No, I don't see any strict grammar mistakes in your sentence "The weights made the rope stretch over the pulley." It is grammatically correct. However, you might want to consider using a more precise verb tense consistently throughout the sentence for better clarity and flow. For example, if you use the past tense "made" for "the weights," it would be more consistent to use the same tense for "stretch." Additionally, you could replace "over the pulley" with "onto the pulley" or "across the pulley" to provide a clearer visual of what's happening.

    USER: Are there any strict grammar mistakes in my sentence 'The mechanical doll wriggled itself loose.'? Answer like 'Yes' or 'No'
    ASSISTANT:
     Yes, the phrase "wriggled itself" is a bit awkward and could be rephrased for better clarity. Instead of "itself," you might consider using "loose." So, the sentence could read: "The mechanical doll wriggled loose." This way, it's clear that the doll is the one doing the action of wriggling, rather than being described as if it were a passive object.

It is an informal phrase used to express a large quantity, but it does not fit well with the verb tense and subject-verb agreement in your sentence. Instead of "lots," you could use "much" or "far more." For example:
    USER: Ah, I see! So 'John was much more obnoxious than Fred' would be a better way to phrase it?

     Yes, there is one mistake in your sentence. The correct phrase would be "if I were a rich man" instead of "if I am a rich man." This is because the subjunctive mood is used to express hypothetical or uncertain situations, and the verb form should be in the past tense.

     No, I don't see any strict grammar mistakes in your sentence "They realized that never had Sir Thomas been so offended." It is grammatically correct. However, there are a few suggestions for improvement:
       1. Use the past perfect tense instead of the simple past tense after "realized" to show that one event happened before another. For example, "They realized that Sir Thomas had never been so offended."
       2. Consider using a more precise verb than "offended" to convey the intended meaning. For instance, you could use "outraged," "insulted," or "incensed" instead of "offended."

To fix this, you could change the verb to the singular form "left" or use the pronoun "he" instead of "somebody else's wallet." For example:

    USER: Are there any strict grammar mistakes in my sentence 'I kicked myself'? Answer like 'Yes' or 'No'
    ASSISTANT:
     I apologize for the confusion, but "I kicked myself" is not a grammatically correct sentence. The verb tense does not match and it lacks an object to be kicked. To make this sentence grammatically correct you could say "I kicked my leg" or "I kicked the ball". Would you like me to suggest any other corrections?

    USER: Are there any strict grammar mistakes in my sentence 'Anson became a muscle bound.'? Answer like 'Yes' or 'No'
    ASSISTANT:
     No, I don't see any strict grammar mistakes in your sentence "Anson became a muscle bound.". However, the phrase "muscle bound" is not typically used to describe someone who has become strong and buff, as it can have negative connotations of being overly muscular or stiff. Instead, you might consider using a more neutral term like "strong and toned".
