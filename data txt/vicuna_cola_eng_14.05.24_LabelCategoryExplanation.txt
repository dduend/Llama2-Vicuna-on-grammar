1. No. 2. None. 3. There are no grammar mistakes in the sentence. It is grammatically correct.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence could be improved by using more specific and descriptive language. For example: "The weights caused the rope to stretch and hang over the pulley."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is almost correct, but "wriggled itself loose" is a bit awkward and could be improved. A better version might be: "The mechanical doll squirmed and wriggled until it was able to loosen itself."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct, but it could be improved for clarity. The meaning of the sentence is not entirely clear, and it might be difficult for someone to understand exactly what you are trying to say. A better version might be: "If you had eaten more, you would feel less hungry."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct, but it could be improved for clarity. The meaning of the sentence is not entirely clear, and it might be difficult for someone to understand exactly what you are trying to say. A better version might be: "The more you eat, the less hungry you feel."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct, but it could be improved for clarity. The meaning of the sentence is not entirely clear, and it might be difficult for someone to understand exactly what you are trying to say. A better version might be: "The more you would want to eat, the less you would actually eat."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The correct version of the sentence would be: "I demand that the more John eats, the more he pays.". In this sentence, the subject is "I" and the verb is "demand." The phrase "the more John eat" is in the present participle form and is used as the direct object of the verb "demand." The phrase "the more he pays" is the indirect object of the verb "demand." The verb "pays" is in the third-person singular form because the indirect object "he" is a singular noun. In English, we use the present participle form with "more" to talk about quantities or conditions that are greater or greater in degree. The present participle is the form that ends in "-ing" and is used as the second element of the compound verb form. In this sentence, "eats" is the present participle form of the verb "eat."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct, but it could be improved for clarity. The meaning of the sentence is not entirely clear, and it might be difficult for someone to understand exactly what you are trying to say. A better version might be: "Mary listens to the Grateful Dead, and it makes her feel depressed.". In this sentence, "Mary" is the subject, "listens" is the verb, and "to the Grateful Dead" is the object of the verb. The phrase "she gets depressed" is a subordinate clause that explains the effect of listening to the Grateful Dead on Mary's mood. This subordinate clause could be rewritten as a independent clause by using the word "and" to connect the two clauses.
1. No. 2. None. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct. It is in the past tense and uses the present perfect tense to describe the relationship between Mary's anger and her behavior of looking at pictures. The subject is "Mary," the verb is "looked," and the object of the verb is "pictures." The adverb "more" describes the degree to which Mary looked at pictures as her anger increased.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is almost correct, but it would be better if it were rephrased as "The higher the stakes, the lower his expectations are." This version correctly places the subject "his expectations" before the verb "are." In this sentence, "The higher the stakes" is a noun clause that functions as the subject. The verb is "are," and the object of the verb is "his expectations." The phrase "the lower his expectations are" is in the passive voice, and it indicates that his expectations are influenced by the stakes. The passive voice is often used when the doer of the action is unknown or when the focus is on the object of the action. In general, it is a good idea to use the active voice whenever possible, because it is more direct and concise. However, in this case, the passive voice is appropriate because the focus is on the relationship between the stakes and his expectations, rather than on the person who has the expectations.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct, but it could be improved for clarity. The meaning of the sentence is not entirely clear, and it might be difficult for someone to understand exactly what you are trying to say. A better version might be: "The more obnoxious Fred is, the less attention you should give him.". In this sentence, "Fred" is the subject, "is" is the copula verb, and "obnoxious" is the predicate adjective. The phrase "the more" is used to indicate the degree or quantity of Fred's obnoxious behavior. The verb "should" is in the imperative mood, and it indicates what the listener should do. The phrase "the less attention" is in the passive voice, and it indicates what the listener should avoid doing. The passive voice is often used when the doer of the action is unknown or when the focus is on the object of the action. In this case, the focus is on the relationship between Fred's behavior and the listener's attention. By using the passive voice, the sentence emphasizes the fact that the listener should not pay attention to Fred. In general, it is a good idea to use the active voice whenever possible, because it is more direct and concise. However, in this case, the passive voice is appropriate because the focus is on the relationship between Fred's behavior and the listener's attention, rather than on the person who should pay attention.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is almost correct, but it would be better if it were rephrased as "John was much more obnoxious than Fred." This version correctly uses the comparative form of the adverb "more," which is "much," to compare the degree of obnoxiousness between John and Fred. In this sentence, "John" is the subject, "was" is the past tense form of the verb "be," and "lots more obnoxious" is the predicate adjective phrase. The phrase "than Fred" is a preposition phrase that indicates the comparison between John and Fred. The comparative form of the adverb "more" is used to indicate a greater degree or quantity of a quality or characteristic. In this sentence, "more" is used to compare the degree of obnoxiousness between John and Fred. The comparative form of "more" is "much" when the degree is very great. In general, it is a good idea to use the comparative form of the adverb "more" when comparing two things, and to use the superlative form of the adverb "most" when comparing three or more things. However, in this case, the comparative form of "more" is appropriate because the sentence is comparing two things, John and Fred.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is not clear what the relationship is between "people you give beer to" and "people get sick." It is also unclear what the subject of the sentence is. A possible revision could be: "The more people you give beer to, the more people will get sick."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is not clear what the relationship is between "Bill smoke" and "Susan hates him." It is also unclear what the subject of the sentence is. A possible revision could be: "The more Bill smokes, the more Susan hates him."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is not clear what the relationship is between "pictures of him that appear in the news" and "John becomes embarrassed." It is also unclear what the subject of the sentence is. A possible revision could be: "The more pictures of him that appear in the news, the more embarrassed John becomes."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is not clear what the relationship is between "senator" and "he talks to more lobbyists." It is also unclear what the subject of the sentence is. A possible revision could be: "Every senator seems to become more corrupt as he talks to more lobbyists."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is not clear what the relationship is between "John" and "Sally." It is also unclear what the subject of the sentence is. A possible revision could be: "Why does John visit Sally?"
1. No. 2. None. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct and clear in its meaning. There are no mistakes in the sentence.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is not clear what the subject of the sentence is. A possible revision could be: "He couldn't have been working." Note that "could not have been" is the past modal form of "can't be" and is used to express a hypothetical situation in the past. The revised sentence implies that it was not possible for the subject to have been working.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is not clear what the subject of the sentence is. A possible revision could be: "He couldn't have been working." Note that "can not have been" is the past modal form of "can't be" and is used to express a hypothetical situation in the past.

1. No. 2. None. 3. There are no grammar mistakes in the sentence. It is grammatically correct.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is not clear what the subject of the sentence is. A possible revision could be: "I never saw a place like Bangor in my life.". Note that "never" is a negative adverb and is used to indicate that the speaker has not seen a place like Bangor in their entire life. The revised sentence implies that the speaker is reporting an experience from their past. The use of "had" is not necessary in this context as the sentence is not referring to a completed past action.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is not clear what the subject of the sentence is. A possible revision could be: "Mickey looked it up.". Note that "it" is used as a pronoun and is not clear what it refers to. The revised sentence implies that Mickey is the subject of the sentence and that they looked up something. The use of "up" is not necessary in this context as it is not clear what Mickey was looking up.
1. No. 2. None. 3. There are no grammar mistakes in the sentence. It is grammatically correct.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is not clear what the subject of the sentence is. A possible revision could be: "John tried to be good.". Note that "boy" is not necessary in this context and is unclear what it refers to. The revised sentence implies that John is the subject of the sentence and that he is trying to be good. The use of "to be" is the verb "to be" in its present participle form, indicating that John is trying to be good in the present moment.

This revised sentence makes it clear that the ball was the subject of the sentence and that the box was the object of the verb "contained."
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. There are two mistakes in the sentence. The first mistake is that the verb "escape" is not in the correct tense. The correct tense for this sentence would be "escaped" because the action of escaping has already happened. The second mistake is that the word "gas" is not in the correct form. The correct form would be "gas" instead of "gas" because "gas" is a singular noun and does not require the "-es" ending.
1. No. 2. None. 3. There are no grammar mistakes in the sentence. It is grammatically correct.
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. There is a mistake in the sentence because it is not clear what the subject of the sentence is.

1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The mistake in the sentence is that the subject of the second clause "did" is missing. The sentence could be grammatically correct if it was revised to something like: "What the water did to the bottle was to fill it." This revised sentence makes it clear that the subject of the second clause is "water" and that the verb "fill" is the predicate.
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The mistake in the sentence is that the subject of the second clause "did" is still missing. The sentence could be grammatically correct if it was revised to something like: "What the water did to the whole bottle was to fill it up." This revised sentence makes it clear that the subject of the second clause is "water" and that the verb "fill" is the predicate. It also makes it clear that the bottle was filled with water.
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The mistake in the sentence is that the object of the verb "leaked" should be "out" instead of "free".

This revised sentence makes it clear that "Mary" was persuaded to leave and "Sue" was persuaded to stay.
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The mistake in the sentence is that the sentence is too long and complex, which makes it difficult to understand. The sentence could be grammatically correct if it was revised to something like: "Most people probably consider Klaus guilty of murder, even though the courts did not actually find him guilty." This revised sentence makes it clear that "Klaus" is the subject of the sentence and that "probably consider" is the verb.

1. No. 2. None. 3. There are no grammar mistakes in the sentence. It is grammatically correct.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence contains a syntax error. The phrase "as a genuine linguist" should be set off with a pair of commas to show that it is nonessential to the sentence. The corrected sentence would be: "They represented seriously to the dean Mary as a genuine linguist, that is, someone who has a deep understanding and knowledge of language and linguistic principles."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence "Us love they" contains a syntax error. The subject of the sentence should be "We" (since "Us" is a plural pronoun referring to a group including the speaker), but the verb "love" is in the third person singular form "loves." The correct sentence would be "We love they" (assuming "they" is a third person plural subject). However, the sentence is still grammatically incorrect because "love" should be in its plural form "loves" to agree with the subject "we." The correct sentence would be "We love them."

1. No. 2. None. 3. There are no grammar mistakes in the sentence. It is grammatically correct.
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The sentence is missing an auxiliary verb in the second clause to form a past perfect tense. A possible correction could be: "Rusty talked about himself only after Mary had talked about him." or "Rusty talked about himself only after Mary talked about him." Alternatively, you could use a different verb tense in the second clause to create a simple past tense, as in: "Rusty talked about himself only after Mary talked about him."
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The sentence is missing an auxiliary verb in the second clause to form a past perfect tense. A possible correction could be: "Fred talked about everything before Rusty had talked about something." or "Fred talked about everything before Rusty talked about something."

Therefore, you could consider using a different verb to convey the meaning of your sentence.
1. No 2. None 3. The sentence is grammatically correct.
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The sentence is missing an object pronoun to complete the predicate. A possible correction could be: "We elected me president." or "We elected me to the board."

1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The sentence is missing an auxiliary verb to form a past perfect tense. A possible correction could be: "Which report that John had submitted did he submit as incompetent?" or "Which report that John submitted did he submit as incompetent?". Alternatively, you could use a different verb tense to create a simple past tense, as in: "Which report did he submit as incompetent?". Note that the phrase "did he submit as incompetent" is in the passive voice, as it emphasizes the report rather than the person who submitted it. If you want to emphasize the person who submitted the report, you could use the active voice, as in: "Which report did John submit as incompetent?"
1. No 2. None 3. The sentence is grammatically correct.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The correct sentence should be "He let the cats out that were whining." The subject "He" and verb "let" should agree in number, so "let the cats out" should be in singular form, not plural. Additionally, "out that" should be replaced with "out" to properly indicate the location where the cats were let. Finally, the word "that" is needed to clarify which cats were let out, as "out" on its own is ambiguous.
1. No. 2. None. 3. There are no grammar mistakes in the sentence "What did Bill buy?" It is a simple question with clear syntax and proper morphology.
1. No. 2. None. 3. There are no grammar mistakes in the sentence "Mary saw the boy walking toward the railroad station." The sentence is grammatically correct with proper syntax, morphology, and semantics.

Finally, the phrase "had been made" should be in the past perfect tense to accurately reflect the timing of the proof being given.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The correct sentence should be "He attributed the fire, which destroyed most of my factory, to a short circuit caused by an overloaded transducer." The sentence is somewhat long and complex, but it can be broken up and simplified for clarity. Note: The original sentence is grammatically correct, but it could be improved by rephrasing for clarity and readability.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The correct sentence should be "The mayor regarded the proposal to build a sidewalk from Dartmouth to Smith as absurd."

Additionally, "as being absurd" should be replaced with "as absurd" to properly indicate the reason for the mayor's opinion.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The correct sentence should be "I want Bill to leave to remain a secret." The subject "I" and verb "want" should agree in number, so "want" should be in singular form, not plural. Additionally, "that" is unnecessary and should be removed. Finally, "left to remain" should be in the correct order of "leave to remain" to properly convey the meaning of the sentence.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The correct sentence should be "I know a man who Tom drives, as do I." The subject "I" and verb "know" should agree in number, so "know" should be in singular form, not plural. Additionally, "drives as drives" should be replaced with "drives, as do I" to properly convey the meaning of the sentence.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The correct sentence should be "Drowning cats, which is against the law, are hard to rescue." The subject "Drowning cats" and verb "are" should agree in number, so "are" should be in plural form, not singular. Additionally, "which is against the law" should be in quotation marks to properly indicate that it is a clause modifying the noun "cats." Finally, "hard to rescue" should be in the correct order of "difficult to rescue" to properly convey the meaning of the sentence.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The correct sentence should be "Muriel said nothing other than that she had been insulted." The subject "Muriel" and verb "said" should agree in number, so "said" should be in singular form, not plural. Additionally, "nothing else than" should be replaced with "nothing other than" to properly convey the meaning of the sentence. Finally, "than" should be changed to "other" to properly indicate the comparison being made.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The correct sentence should be "Rutherford understands himself." The subject "Rutherford" and verb "understands" should agree in number, so "understands" should be in singular form, not plural. Additionally, "himself" should be removed as it is unnecessary and can cause confusion as to who is being referred to.
1. No. 2. None. 3. There are no grammar mistakes in the sentence "I feel that Arch will show up." The sentence is grammatically correct with proper syntax, morphology, and semantics.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The correct sentence should be "The proof that this set is recursive is difficult." The subject "The proof" and verb "is" should agree in number, so "is" should be in singular form, not plural.

1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistake is that the verb "can" is not necessary in this sentence, it's implied that you saw the gas can, you can use "I saw a gas can." or "I saw the gas can.". The corrected sentence could be: "I saw the gas can explode." or "I saw a gas can explode.". Please note that "gas can" is a common way to refer to a gasoline container in the US, in the UK it's more commonly referred to as a "petrol can".

1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence "John put under the bathtub" is grammatically incorrect. A more appropriate way to express this idea is "John put the bathtub under." This sentence is grammatically correct and means that John placed the bathtub in a lower position by lifting it up and placing it under something else.

The sentence could have been corrected by using the past participle form of the verb "nominate" in the correct tense, and adding a comma to separate "unpopular" and "Bill."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because "possible FTA" is not a complete phrase or clause.

1. No. 2. None. 3. There are no mistakes in the sentence. It is grammatically correct.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is a double negative. The phrase "of students" is unnecessary and can be omitted. A possible corrected sentence could be: "None of the students failed." The sentence could have been corrected by using the negative form of the verb "failed" and omitting the unnecessary phrase "of the students." Note: The sentence implies that all of the students passed the test or the assignment, as "none" means "not one" or "no one."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because "water" is an uncountable noun and should not be preceded by "some of.". A possible corrected sentence could be: "I drank some water.". The sentence could have been corrected by using the correct form of the noun "water" and omitting the unnecessary article "some.".

Note: The sentence is a bit confusing because "hair" is usually a plural noun, but it can also be used as a singular collective noun to refer to a person's hair. In this case, it seems to refer to a single hair that is golden in color.
1. No. 2. None. 3. There are no mistakes in the sentence. It is grammatically correct.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the word order is not clear. It is unclear whether the dog is trying to bite itself or someone else. To make the sentence clearer, you could say, "It tried to bite the dog" or "It tried to bite itself."

1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The sentence is grammatically correct, but it could be improved by making the verb tenses consistent.

1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence "The bed was slept in" is grammatically incorrect. The correct form would be "The bed was slept on" or "The bed was used."

1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence "A pound was weighed by the book" is grammatically incorrect. The correct form would be "The book weighed a pound."

1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence "The committee knows whose efforts to achieve peace the world should honor" is grammatically incorrect. The correct form would be "The committee knows whose efforts should be honored for achieving peace." In this sentence, "whose efforts to achieve peace" is a restrictive relative clause that should be set off with commas, not a conjunction. Additionally, the verb "to achieve" should be in its base form "achieve" as it is the object of the preposition "for." Finally, the word "should" should be changed to "should be" to reflect the correct tense for the clause. Here's the corrected sentence: "The committee knows whose efforts should be honored for achieving peace."

1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence "Jack is the person with whom Jenny fell in love with" has a grammatical mistake. The correct form would be "Jack is the person with whom Jenny fell in love."

1. No. 2. None. 3. The sentence "There is a bench to sit on" is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning. It is a properly formed sentence using the present tense verb "is" to indicate existence and the infinitive phrase "to sit on" to indicate the purpose of the bench.

1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence "Which topic did you choose without getting his approval?" has a grammatical mistake. The correct form would be "Which topic did you choose without getting his approval?" The verb "choose" is in the past tense, but the sentence is in the present tense, so it should be in its base form "choose." Additionally, the phrase "getting his approval" is a gerund phrase and should be in its infinitive form "getting his approval" to function as a phrase in the sentence. Here's the corrected sentence: "Which topic did you choose without getting his approval?"
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because "get bored" is not a phrasal verb that takes an object after it. The correct phrasal verb form is "get bored with" or "get bored of." Therefore, the sentence should be written as: "Which topic did you get bored with/of because Mary talked about it?"
1. No 2. None 3. The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence with a subject ("he"), a verb ("resigned"), an adverb ("why"), and a conjunction ("because").

1. No 2. None 3. The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence with a subject ("Kim"), a verb ("is"), an adjective ("eager"), an object ("to please Tom"), and a conjunction ("that"). The use of the present progressive form of the verb "is" to indicate the current state of Kim's eagerness is appropriate, and the subject and verb agree in number. The preposition "to" followed by the infinitive "to please Tom" is also grammatically correct, indicating the purpose or goal of Kim's eagerness.
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because "That" is a demonstrative pronoun that refers to a specific noun or noun phrase, but the sentence does not have a noun phrase that follows it. If you want to express your disapproval of the invasion of Iraq, you could use a declarative sentence with a subject and verb, such as "I disapprove of the invasion of Iraq" or "The invasion of Iraq is a mistake.". The phrase "really bites" is also informal and colloquial, and might not be appropriate in a formal context. If you want to use a similar phrase to express your disapproval, you could say "really stinks" or "is a huge mistake."
1. No 2. None 3. The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence with a subject ("I"), a verb ("annoys"), an object ("that Fido barks"), and a conjunction ("that"). The use of the present tense of the verb "annoys" to indicate the current state of the speaker's annoyance is appropriate, and the subject and verb agree in number. The relative pronoun "that" introduces a noun clause that acts as the object of the verb "annoys," and the phrase "Fido barks" is a noun clause functioning as the direct object of the verb.
1. No 2. None 3. The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence with a subject ("who"), a verb ("achieved"), a relative pronoun ("who") introducing a noun clause ("who achieved the best result"), an object ("the best result"), and a conjunction ("was"). The use of the present perfect tense of the verb "achieved" to indicate the result achieved by someone in the past is appropriate, and the subject and verb agree in number. The relative pronoun "who" introduces the noun clause "who achieved the best result," and the phrase "was Angela" is a noun clause functioning as the subject of the sentence.
1. No 2. None 3. The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence with a subject ("it"), a verb ("was"), a modifier ("the peasant girl"), and a complement ("who got it"). The use of the past tense of the verb "was" to indicate a past state of the subject is appropriate, and the modifier "the peasant girl" describes the subject "it," while the complement "who got it" provides more information about the action performed by the subject.
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the word order is not appropriate. A more grammatically correct version of the sentence could be: "It is hard to find anyone to look after that kind of person.". The word "that" introduces a restrictive relative clause that modifies the noun "person," and the clause "who is hard to find anyone to look after" functions as the direct object of the verb "look after." The pronoun "who" is omitted because it is unnecessary in this sentence.
1. No 2. None 3. The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence with a subject ("a sick owl"), a verb ("doesn't"), an object ("hunt mice"), and a conjunction ("doesn't"). The use of the present tense of the verb "hunt" with the negative form "doesn't" indicates that a sick owl does not engage in this activity. The subject and verb agree in number, and the word order is appropriate.
1. No 2. None 3. The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a complex sentence with a main clause ("Each candidate will be admitted to the department") and a subordinate clause ("who has interest in semantics"). The relative pronoun "who" introduces the subordinate clause, which functions as the subject of the sentence. The word "interest" is a singular noun, and the plural form "interests" is not appropriate in this context.
1. No 2. None 3. The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a complex sentence with a main clause ("Each author will provide a summary in English") and a subordinate clause ("whose contribution is written in any language other than English"). The relative pronoun "whose" introduces the subordinate clause, which functions as the subject of the sentence. The phrase "contribution is written in any language other than English" is a participle phrase modifying the noun "contribution," and it functions as an adjective describing the noun.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is missing an auxiliary verb to form the negative construction. The correct sentence would be "I'm sure we didn't even get these tickets!"
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is missing an auxiliary verb to form the negative construction. The correct sentence would be "I'm not even sure if we got these tickets!"

1. No 2. None 3. There are no mistakes in the sentence. It is grammatically correct.
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the incorrect use of the pronoun "himself."

1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the negative form "did not" should be used with the singular form "man," not the plural form "men." The correct sentence would be "No man ate dinner" or "None of the men ate dinner.".

1. No 2. None 3. There are no mistakes in the sentence. It is grammatically correct.
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the use of the relative clause "whoever they were."

1. No. 2. None. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is not grammatically correct. It should be "Which books about cooking does Henri want to buy?" or "Which books about cooking are Henri wanting to buy?"

1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is not grammatically correct. It should be "Mary cut the paper," or "Mary cut a paper.". The phrase "cut the paper" is a transitive sentence, which means that the subject ("Mary") performs the action ("cut") on the object ("the paper"). The verb "cut" should be in its base form as it is the second verb in the infinitive phrase "cut the paper." Additionally, the sentence could be improved by adding more information or making the meaning clearer. For example, it could be "Mary cut the paper with scissors," or "Mary cut a paper for a craft project."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is not grammatically correct. It should be "It was from six to nine, or it took place from six to nine.".

1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistake is that "arrived" should be in the past tense because the sentence is talking about a past event. The correct sentence would be:  "Suddenly, two inspectors from the INS arrived."
1. Yes, there are grammar mistakes in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistakes are: "The soup cooks" is grammatically correct, but it is incomplete and sounds awkward. It should be followed by a verb or an infinitive to complete the sentence. For example, "The soup cooks on the stove" or "The soup cooks well when you add some herbs.". "thickens" should be in the present tense because the sentence is talking about a current or habitual action. The correct sentence would be: "The soup thickens as it cooks."

1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistake is that the sentence is not grammatically correct because the word "even" is not placed correctly in the sentence. The correct sentence would be: "I saw the student, even.". The word "even" is used to indicate that the action of seeing was unexpected or surprising, and it should be placed at the beginning of the sentence to convey this meaning. The sentence with the correction shows that the subject "I" saw the student, and even though it was unexpected or surprising.
1. Yes, there are grammar mistakes in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistakes are: "John whispered Mary left" is not grammatically correct because it is not clear what the subject of the sentence is. It's not clear if "Mary left" is a separate action or a part of the action of whispering. "left" is not a past participle verb form, it's an adjective, it should be in past participle form "left" to be used as a verb in the sentence. A better way to construct the sentence is "John whispered that Mary had left" or "John whispered that Mary was leaving". It's also worth noting that the sentence is not very clear and it is not clear what the subject of the sentence is, it is not clear what the sentence is trying to say.
1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistake is that the sentence is not grammatically correct because of the word order. The correct sentence would be: "Mary wonders if Bill will come.". The word "wonders" is a verb that expresses the idea of Mary thinking or wondering about something. "if" is a subordinating conjunction that introduces a clause that expresses a condition or uncertain
1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistake is that the sentence is not grammatically correct because the word "theater" is not a verb. It's a noun that refers to a place where plays and performances are presented. The correct sentence would be: "Sophie will go to the theater.". The word "will" is the helping verb that indicates the future tense, and "go" is the main verb that expresses the action of moving towards a place. The word "theater" is a noun that indicates the place where the action is going to happen.

1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistake is that the sentence is not grammatically correct because the word "herself" refers to the subject of the sentence and it should be placed at the beginning of the sentence. The correct sentence would be: "Mary's mother likes herself.". The word "likes" is a linking verb that expresses the idea of liking, and "Mary's mother" is the subject of the sentence, "herself" is an object complement that refers to the subject, in this case, it's Mary's mother.
1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistake is that the sentence is not grammatically correct because the phrase "with some of the other boys" is not clear and it is not clear who is fighting with whom. The correct sentence would be: "Each of the boys fought with some of the other boys.". The word "with" is a preposition that expresses the idea of fighting with something or someone, and "some of the other boys" is a prepositional phrase that refers to the object of the action.
1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistake is that the sentence is not grammatically correct because the word "himself" is a reflexive pronoun and it should be placed at the end of the sentence. The correct sentence would be: "John's mother likes him.". The word "likes" is a linking verb that expresses the idea of liking, and "him" is the object of the action, in this case, it's John, and "himself" is a reflexive pronoun that refers to the object of the action, in this case, it's John.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The pronoun "himself" is unnecessary and the verb tense is incorrect. It should be "Mary revealed herself to John."
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because "saw" is in the past tense, and it is unclear who is doing the seeing in the sentence. A corrected version of the sentence could be: "Mary believes that Bill saw himself." or "Mary believes that Bill sees himself.". Alternatively, if you want to use the past participle form of the verb "see" you can use: "Mary believes that Bill has seen himself."
1. Yes 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because "criticized" is in the past tense and it is not clear who is doing the criticizing in the sentence. It could be "John heard that they criticized themselves" or "John heard that they have criticized themselves."

1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses the present tense of the verb "is" which is the auxiliary verb for the past participle "sad" and it is not clear who is doing the finding in the sentence. A corrected version of the sentence could be: "Henry found that Bill is sad" or "Henry found that Bill has been sad." Alternatively, if you want to use the present participle form of the verb "be" you can use: "Henry found that Bill is being sad."
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the verb "considers" is in the present tense, which suggests that John is currently considering something, but it's not clear what he is considering.

1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence should be: "I inquired when we could leave." The subject "I" is singular, so the verb "inquire" should agree in number with the subject.

1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is incomplete and unclear. It appears to be a fragment rather than a complete sentence. It also lacks context and subject/verb agreement. The correct form would depend on the intended meaning and context of the sentence.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence should be: "The monkey ate the banana." The past participle "ate" should agree in tense with the subject "monkey." The verb "ate" is in the simple past tense, which agrees with the subject "monkey.". The sentence is also in the active voice, where the subject "monkey" performs the action of eating the banana.

1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence should be: "I would like to be able to swim." The correct form of the verb "like" is "would like to," which is in the conditional mood, expressing a desire or a possibility. The verb "could" is a modal verb that expresses ability or possibility, but it is often used with "be able to" to express the same meaning. The use of "could" alone in the sentence is incorrect because it implies that the speaker is capable of swimming, but not necessarily willing or able to do so. The correct form, "I would like to be able to swim," expresses a desire to be able to swim in the future.
1. No. 2. None. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is incorrect. The subject "bookcase" is a non-living thing and cannot perform the action of "ran," which is typically associated with living beings.

Alternatively, if you meant to say that the bookcase was being used as a container for something that ran, you could say "The bookcase contained something that ran."
1. No. 2. None. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The correct sentence should be: "Anson became muscle-bound." The adjective "muscle-bound" describes the noun "Anson," but it should be hyphenated to indicate that it is a compound adjective modifying "Anson." Additionally, "muscle-bound" should be in attributive noun form, which means it should be separated from the noun it modifies by a space.  The sentence suggests that "muscle-bound" is a noun or a proper noun, which is incorrect. It is an adjective that describes a condition or a state of being.
