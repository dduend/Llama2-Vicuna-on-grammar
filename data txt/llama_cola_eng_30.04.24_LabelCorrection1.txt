      USER: I wrote a sentence in English, but I'm not sure if it's grammatically correct. Here's my sentence: The bookcase ran 1. Are there any strict grammar mistakes in my sentence? Write 'Yes.' or 'No.'; 2. If there is a mistake, what is the correct version of the sentence? Write only the correct version of the sentence and nothing else.
      ASSISTANT:
      1. No. There are several grammatical errors in your sentence. The word "ran" should be changed to "is running" because it's a continuous action, not an instantaneous one. Additionally, you need to change "The bookcase" to "A bookcase" because "bookcase" is an uncountable noun and cannot be made plural. Finally, there should be no comma after "1."
      2. Here's the corrected sentence: A bookcase is running 1.
