      ASSISTANT:
      1. No. There are several issues with your sentence:
          - The verb tense is inconsistent. "Clearly" suggests that the action of John learning French is already completed, but "will immediately learn" implies that it will happen in the future. To fix this, you could change "will" to "has."
          - The word "probably" is unnecessary and can be removed.

      3. (Bonus) If you want to express a future intention that is not yet certain or confirmed, you could use the present continuous instead of the simple present: I hope to be studying in France. This would convey more uncertainty and tentativeness about your plans.

      1. No. There are no strict grammar mistakes in your sentence. However...
      2. You might consider rephrasing it to make it more idiomatic. Here's why:
          The verb "bothers" is a bit formal for everyday speech, and it can also sound a bit judgmental (as if you find John's coughing to be bothersome or annoying). Instead of using "bothers," you could use the more neutral word "concerns." Here's the corrected sentence:
          It concerns me that John coughs.
