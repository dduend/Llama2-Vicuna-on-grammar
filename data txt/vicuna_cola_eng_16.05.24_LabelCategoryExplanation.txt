1. Yes. 2. Syntax and Morphology. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of a syntax error and a morphological error. The correct way to say this sentence would be "I demand that the more John eats, the more he pays." The word "eat" is the correct form of the verb in this context, and "eats" is the third person singular present tense form of the verb. Also, "more" should be in the comparative form "more" and not in the superlative form "most"
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of a syntax error. The correct way to say this sentence would be "Mary listens to the Grateful Dead, and she gets depressed." or "Mary listens to the Grateful Dead, which makes her depressed."

1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The main mistake in the sentence is the use of the phrase "get sick" without a linking verb or a helping verb. The correct way to structure this sentence would be: "The more people you give beer to, the sicker they get."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The main mistake in the sentence is the use of the word "does" instead of "he" as the subject of the second clause. The correct way to structure this sentence would be: "The more Bill smokes, the more Susan hates him."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The main mistake in the sentence is the use of the phrase "of him" without a linking verb or a helping verb. The correct way to structure this sentence would be: "The more pictures of him that appear in the news, the more embarrassed John becomes."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The main mistake in the sentence is the use of the pronoun "he" without a clear antecedent. The subject of the sentence is "senator", so the correct way to structure this sentence would be: "Every senator seems to become more corrupt as he talks to more lobbyists."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The main mistake in the sentence is the use of the phrase "because he likes" without a clear subject or verb. The correct way to structure this sentence would be: "John visits Sally because he likes her."
1. No. 2. None. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct and clear. It falls under the category of semantics.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The main mistake in the sentence is the use of the past participle "been" without a main verb. The correct way to structure this sentence would be: "He could not have been working in the garden."

1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The sentence is awkwardly constructed and could be revised for clarity. One possible revision is: "The ball was in the box, and it came from the tree."
1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is not clear who or what escaped the tube. The correct sentence would be: "Gas escaped from the tube."
1. No, there are no grammar mistakes in your sentence. 2. None. 3. There are no mistakes in the sentence. It is grammatically correct.
1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The sentence is not grammatically correct because the subject of the sentence is missing. The correct sentence would be: "The tub leaked water."  In the original sentence, "leaked water" is a prepositional phrase that is not functioning as a complete sentence. The revised sentence makes it clear that the tub was leaking water.
1. No, there are no grammar mistakes in your sentence. 2. None. 3. There are no mistakes in the sentence. It is grammatically correct.
1. Yes, there is a grammatical mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the phrase "to the whole bottle" is redundant and unnecessary. The correct sentence would be: "What the water did was fill the whole bottle." In the original sentence, "to the whole bottle" is not a complete prepositional phrase, and it does not add any meaning to the sentence. The revised sentence makes it clear that the water filled the whole bottle.
1. Yes, there is a grammatical mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the verb "leaked" requires a direct object to complete its meaning. The correct sentence would be: "The tank leaked fluid free." In the original sentence, "free" is not a direct object of the verb "leaked." The revised sentence makes it clear that the tank leaked fluid, and the fluid was free-flowing. Also, note that "fluid" should be preceded by "the" as it is a definite noun.
1. No, there are no grammar mistakes in your sentence. 2. None. 3. There are no mistakes in the sentence. It is grammatically correct.
1. No, there are no grammar mistakes in your sentence. 2. None. 3. There are no mistakes in the sentence. It is grammatically correct.
1. Yes, there is a grammatical mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the two clauses are not joined correctly. The correct sentence would be: "We persuaded Mary to leave and Sue to stay." In the original sentence, the two clauses are joined with a comma, which is not a correct way to join two independent clauses. The revised sentence makes it clear that we persuaded Mary to leave and Sue to stay. Also, note that "to leave" and "to stay" should be in the infinitive form without "and."
1. Yes, there are grammar mistakes in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax and semantics. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the following issues: The use of "even though" suggests that the courts did find Klaus guilty of murder, which contradicts the statement "the courts didn't actually find, Klaus guilty of murder." This inconsistency is a semantic mistake. The sentence structure is not clear and could be improved for clarity. Here's a suggested revision: "Although the courts did not actually find Klaus guilty of murder, most people probably consider him guilty." This revision avoids the inconsistency between the use of "even though" and the statement about the courts' findings. It also improves the sentence structure for clarity.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct, but it would be more natural to say "Mary plays the violin beautifully." This is because the adverb "beautifully" typically modifies the verb "plays" rather than the noun "violin."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct, but it could be improved for clarity. The phrase "Clearly, John probably will immediately learn French perfectly" could be rewritten as "John will probably learn French immediately, and he will learn it perfectly." This separates the two independent clauses and makes the meaning clearer.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct, but it would be more natural to say "Sue gave Bill a book." This is because the preposition "to" is usually not used when the person being given something is the second object in the sentence.
1. No. 2. None. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning.
1. No. 2. None. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct, but it could be improved for clarity. The phrase " They represented seriously to the dean Mary as a genuine linguist" could be rewritten as "They represented Mary seriously to the dean as a genuine linguist." This separates the two independent clauses and makes the meaning clearer.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The subject "Us" is plural, but the verb "love" is not in agreement with the subject. It should be "We love they" to make the subject and verb agree in number. However, it's worth noting that the sentence is grammatically incorrect even when the verb is in agreement with the subject. The sentence is in the passive voice, which can be confusing and is not typically used in everyday speech or writing. A better sentence might be "We love them" or "They are loved by us."
1. No. 2. None. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning.
1. No. 2. None. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning.
1. No. 2. None. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The subject "I" is singular, but the verb "won't, either" is in the plural form. It should be "I can't believe that Fred won't, either" to make the subject and verb agree in number. However, it's worth noting that the sentence is grammatically incorrect even when the verb is in agreement with the subject. The sentence is in a redundant construction, which can be confusing and is not typically used in everyday speech or writing. A better sentence might be "I can't believe that Fred won't either." This eliminates the redundant "either" and makes the sentence more concise and easier to understand.
1. No. 2. None. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning.
1. No. 2. None. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning.
1. No. 2. None. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The subject "Holly" is singular, but the verb "shouldn't" is in the negative form of the third person plural present tense. It should be "Mary claimed that eating cabbage, Holly shouldn't" to make the subject and verb agree in number. However, it's worth noting that the sentence is grammatically incorrect even when the verb is in agreement with the subject. The sentence is in a complex sentence structure, which can be confusing and is not typically used in everyday speech or writing. A better sentence might be "Mary said that Holly shouldn't eat cabbage." This simplifies the sentence and makes it more concise and easier to understand.
1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistake is in the word order of the sentence. The correct word order should be: "Mary came to be introduced by the bartender, and I also came to be." The subject of the sentence (Mary) should come before the verb "came to be," and "and I also came to be" should be set off by a comma.
1.No. 2. None. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning.
1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistake is in the use of the word "too" at the end of the sentence. "Too" is typically used to mean "also" or "too much," but in this sentence, it seems like you intended to use it as a conjunction to connect "Sally" to the previous clause. The correct way to do this would be to use "and" instead of "too." The sentence should read: "Joe's neuroses bother his patrons, and Sally does too."
1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistake is in the use of the word "it" in the second clause of the sentence. The pronoun "it" does not clearly refer to any noun in the sentence. It seems like you intended to use "did it" as a way of saying "did the reading for him," but you need to specify which book is being referred to. To fix the sentence, you could change "it" to "the reading" or "the book," depending on which one you meant. The sentence could read: "I know which book José didn't read for class, and which book Lilly did the reading for him."
1. Yes, there are two grammar mistakes in your sentence. 2. The categories of the mistakes are syntax and morphology. 3. The first mistake is in the use of the word "it" without a clear antecedent. The pronoun "it" does not refer to any noun in the sentence, and it is unclear what "it" is referring to. To fix this, you could change "it" to "the reading" or "the book" to make it clear which one you are referring to. The sentence should read: "This is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one which Fred won't do the reading." The second mistake is in the use of the word "won't" instead of "will not." "Won't" is a contraction of "will not," but in this sentence, it is not used correctly. To fix this, you could change "won't" to "will not" to make the sentence grammatically correct. The sentence should read: "This is the book which Bob reviewed, and this is the one which Fred will not do the reading."
1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistake is in the use of the word "that" in the second clause of the sentence. The word "that" is used as a conjunction to connect the clause to the previous clause, but it is not necessary in this case. To fix the sentence, you could remove "that" and change "hadn't" to "had not" to make the sentence grammatically correct. The sentence should read: "I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob said you hadn't read."
1. Yes, there are two grammar mistakes in your sentence. 2. The categories of the mistakes are syntax and morphology. 3. The first mistake is in the use of the word "that" without a clear antecedent. The word "that" is used as a conjunction to connect the clause to the previous clause, but it is not necessary in this case. To fix this, you could remove "that" and change "my report" to "the report" to make it clear which report is being referred to. The sentence should read: "I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob read the report that you hadn't." The second mistake is in the use of the word "haven't" instead of "had not." "Haven't" is a contraction of "have not" and "has not," but in this sentence, it is not used correctly. To fix this, you could change "haven't" to "had not" to make the sentence grammatically correct. The sentence should read: "I know which book Mag read, and which book Bob read the report that you hadn't."
1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistake is in the use of the word "than" between "I" and "he." "Than" is used for comparisons between two things, but in this sentence, it is not necessary. To fix the sentence, you could remove "than" and change "him" to "he" to make the sentence grammatically correct. The sentence should read: "I'm sure I would like him to eat fruit more than I would cookies."
1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistake is in the use of the word "about" without a clear antecedent. The word "about" is used to indicate the topic of conversation, but it is not clear what Rusty is talking "about." To fix the sentence, you could change "about" to "to" to make it clear that Rusty is talking to someone. The sentence should read: "Rusty talked to himself only after Mary did talk about him."
1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistake is in the use of the word "before" between "Fred" and "Rusty." "Before" is used to indicate the order of events, but in this sentence, it is not necessary. To fix the sentence, you could remove "before" and change "about" to "to" to make it clear that Fred is talking to someone. The sentence should read: "Fred talked to everyone after Rusty did talk about something."
1. No. 2. None. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning.
1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistake is in the order of the words in the sentence. "The problem" should be followed by "perceives" and "easily" should be set off by a pair of commas. The correct way to write this sentence would be: "The problem, perceives easily, is a common one." Alternatively, if you intended to use "perceives" as a verb and "easily" as an adverb, you could change the sentence to: "The problem perceives easily." This sentence is not grammatically incorrect, but it would be more natural to add an article before "problem" to make it "a problem." The sentence would then read: "A problem perceives easily."
1. No. 2. None. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct and has a clear meaning.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The subject of the sentence should be "we" not "me". The correct sentence would be "We elected me."
1. No. 2. None. 3. No mistakes were found in the sentence.
1. No. 2. None. 3. No mistakes were found in the sentence.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. There should be a comma after "cats" to separate the two clauses, and the verb "were" should be in its base form "was" since the subject is singular (i.e. "He" is a single person). The correct sentence would be "He let the cats out, which were whining."
1. No. 2. None. 3. No mistakes were found in the sentence.
1. No. 2. None. 3. No mistakes were found in the sentence.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. There should be a comma after "made" to separate the two clauses, and the verb "had been" should be in its base form "was" since the subject is singular (i.e. "A proof" is a single thing). The correct sentence would be "A proof that the claim had been made was given that John had lied."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. There should be a comma after "circuit" to separate the two clauses, and the verb "was caused" should be in its base form "caused" since the subject is singular (i.e. "an overloaded transducer" is a single thing). Also, the phrase "which destroyed most of my factory" should be set off with commas to show that it is nonessential to the meaning of the sentence. The correct sentence would be "He attributed the fire, caused by an overloaded transducer which led to a short circuit, to a short circuit caused by an overloaded transducer."
1. No. 2. None. 3. No mistakes were found in the sentence.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because "left to remain" is not a correct phrase. It's not clear what the intended meaning is, but it seems like the speaker wants Bill to leave something and for it to remain a secret. A possible correction could be: "I want Bill to leave and for it to remain a secret."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the subject of the second clause ("Tom drives as drives") is not clear. The correct sentence would depend on what the intended meaning is. Here are two possible corrections: "I know a man who Tom drives as Tom drives." - This sentence means that the man is driven by Tom in the same way that Tom drives himself. "I know a man who Tom drives, and Tom drives." - This sentence means that the man is driven by Tom, and Tom drives himself.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the phrase "drowning cats, which is against the law" is not a complete clause. It's not clear what the intended meaning is, but it seems like the speaker is talking about cats that are drowning and that it's illegal to do something about it. A possible correction could be: "It is against the law to drown cats, and they are hard to rescue." Alternatively, if the intended meaning is that the act of drowning cats is illegal, the sentence could be rephrased as: "Drowning cats is against the law, and it is hard to rescue them."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the phrase "nothing else than that" is not necessary and the sentence can be simplified. The correct sentence would be "Muriel said that she had been insulted." Note that the verb "had been" is in its base form "been" because the subject is singular (i.e. "Muriel").
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct, but it's not clear what the intended meaning is. It's possible that the speaker is talking about someone who is understood by Rutherford, but it's not clear who that person is. A possible correction could be: "Rutherford understands himself." Note that the pronoun "himself" refers to the subject of the sentence, which is not specified. If the intended meaning is that Rutherford understands someone else, the pronoun should be changed to "him" or "himself" should be replaced with a noun.
1. No. 2. None. 3. No mistakes were found in the sentence.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the phrase "this set is recursive" is not a complete clause. The correct sentence would be "The proof that this set is recursive is difficult." Note that the verb "is" agrees with the subject "proof" and not with the intervening phrase "this set."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the clauses are not properly connected. The correct sentence would be "The madrigals that Henry plays and sings on the lute sound lousy." Note that the verb "plays" and "sings" are in their base form "play" and "sing" because the subject is singular (i.e. "Henry"). Also, the phrase "on the lute" is necessary to specify the instrument that Henry plays.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence has a subject-verb agreement mistake. "Tom picked these grapes" is in the past tense, while "Suzie will prepare these grapes" is in the future tense. Additionally, "I washed some turnips" is a complete sentence by itself and should not be linked to the other two sentences with a comma.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence has a grammatical mistake in the word order. "Where did you go" and "who ate what" are two separate questions, but they are combined in a way that creates confusion. The correct sentence would be "Where did you go, and who ate what?" or "Where did you go, who ate what?"
1. Yes. 2. Syntax and Morphology. 3. The sentence has several grammar mistakes. The subject of the sentence is "we" which is plural, but the verb "did we elect" is in the singular form. Additionally, the word "guardian's" should be "guardian" as it refers to the employer of the president, and "employer president" is a redundant phrase. Finally, the sentence lacks proper punctuation. A corrected version could be: "Which boy did we elect as the guardian's employer? And who is the president?"
1. No. 2. None. 3. No mistakes were found in the sentence.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence has a subject-verb agreement mistake. The phrase "my dad lives" is in the present tense, while "I live" is in the present tense as well. However, the verb tenses do not match in both clauses of the sentence. A correct version could be: "I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the River, and my dad lives at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River as well."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence has a subject-verb agreement mistake. The phrase "my dad lives" is in the present tense, while "I live" is in the present tense as well. However, the verb tenses do not match in both clauses of the sentence. A correct version could be: "I live at the place where Route 150 crosses the Hudson River, and my dad lives there as well."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence has a subject-verb agreement mistake. The phrase "who is she" is in the present tense, while "trying to make up" is in the present participle tense. However, the verb tenses do not match in the sentence. A correct version could be: "Who is she trying to make up to now?" or "Who was she trying to make up to now?" depending on the time frame you want to convey.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax and Morphology. 3. The sentence has several errors. The verb "gotten" is not commonly used in standard English, and "of a plot" is not grammatically correct. The correct preposition to use in this context is "by" or "from". Additionally, the verb "negotiate" should be in its past participle form "negotiated" to match the past tense of the sentence. Finally, the word "an" before "honorable end" is unnecessary. A correct version could be: "Wind was gotten from a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam." or "Wind was gotten by a plot to negotiate an honorable end to the war in Vietnam."
1. No. 2. None. 3. No mistakes were found in the sentence.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence has a subject-verb agreement mistake. The phrase "it was expected" is in the past tense, while "the principal would fire" is in the conditional tense. However, the verb tenses do not match in the sentence. A correct version could be: "It was expected by the reporters that the principal would fire some teachers" or "It was expected by the reporters that the principal would fire some teacher" depending on the number of the subject.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence has a subject-verb agreement mistake. The phrase "Mike quip" is in the present tense, while "she never wore" is in the past tense. Additionally, the word "that" is unnecessary in the sentence as the clause "she never wore" already implies the reason for the statement. A correct version could be: "Which hat did Mike say she never wore?"
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence has a subject-verb agreement mistake. The phrase "Mike quip" is in the present tense, while "this hat" is in the present tense. Additionally, the word "that" is unnecessary in the sentence as the clause "this hat" already implies the specific hat being referred to. A correct version could be: "Which girl did Mike say never wore this hat?"
1. Yes. 2. Morphology. 3. The sentence has a morphology mistake. The word "wire" is an uncountable noun, it should be "wired" if you want to use the past participle form to indicate that the action of donating wires has been completed. A correct version could be: "We donated wired for the convicts to build cages with."
1. No. 2. None. 3. No mistakes were found in the sentence.
1. No. 2. None. 3. No mistakes were found in the sentence.
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. There is a grammatical mistake in the sentence "I won't ask you to believe that he tried to force me to give her any money." The mistake is in the word order of the phrase "to give her any money." It should be "to give her any money" instead of "give her any money to." The corrected sentence would be: "I won't ask you to believe that he tried to force me to give her any money."
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. There is a grammatical mistake in the sentence "That Sam sometimes didn't sleep must have pleased somebody." The mistake is in the verb tense inconsistency. "Didn't sleep" is in the past tense, while "pleased" is in the past participle form, which suggests a completed action in the past. The corrected sentence would be: "That Sam sometimes doesn't sleep must have pleased somebody."
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. There is a grammatical mistake in the sentence "I talked to Winston about himself." The mistake is in the word order of the preposition "about." The corrected sentence would be: "I talked to Winston about himself."
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. There are several grammatical mistakes in the sentence "That the fuzz wanted him worried John, but that the fuzz wanted her didn't worry Mary." First, the sentence is a run-on sentence, meaning it contains two independent clauses without proper punctuation or conjunctions to connect them. Second, the pronouns "him" and "her" are ambiguous, and it is unclear who they refer to. Third, the verb tenses are inconsistent. "Worried" is in the simple past tense, while "didn't worry" is in the negative present perfect tense. Fourth, the phrases "wanted him worried" and "wanted her" are not grammatically correct. The correct phrase would be "wanted him worried" or "wanted her worried." The corrected sentence would be: "That the fuzz wanted him worried, but that the fuzz didn't want her to worry Mary."
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. There is a grammatical mistake in the sentence "I'll work on it if Sam will be working on it." The mistake is in the use of the present simple tense "will be" to describe a future action, which is incorrect. The corrected sentence would be: "I'll work on it if Sam is going to work on it."
1. No. 2. None. 3. No mistakes were found in the sentence.
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. There is a grammatical mistake in the sentence "Here's a knife with which for you to cut up the onions." The mistake is in the use of the preposition "with which." The corrected sentence would be: "Here's a knife for you to cut up the onions."
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. There is a grammatical mistake in the sentence "Fluffy is sick, which not everybody knows." The mistake is in the use of the relative pronoun "which." The corrected sentence would be: "Fluffy is sick, and not everybody knows it."
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. There is a grammatical mistake in the sentence "Maxwell is quite a doctor." The mistake is in the use of the adverb "quite." The corrected sentence would be: "Maxwell is a quite good doctor."
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. There are several grammatical mistakes in the sentence "The younger woman might have been tall and, and the older one definitely was, blond." First, the sentence is a run-on sentence, meaning it contains two independent clauses without proper punctuation or conjunctions to connect them. Second, there is a comma splice error between "tall and" and "blond." Third, the adjective "blond" is missing an article ("the"). The corrected sentence would be: "The younger woman might have been tall and, and the older one definitely was blond."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is missing a comma after "tall" to separate the two independent clauses. Additionally, "and may be blond" and "and definitely is blond" are in the wrong order. The correct sentence would be: "Sally is tall, and she may be blond. Sheila is short, and she is definitely blond."
1. No. 2. None. 3. There are no grammatical mistakes in the sentence. It is a grammatically correct sentence in English.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax and semantics. 3. There are two mistakes in this sentence: "for for" is incorrect and should be "for you to put on to be planned" is not a grammatically correct sentence. "put on to be planned" doesn't make sense semantically. It seems that you want to say "put on and be planned" which would be "put on to be planned." The corrected sentence would be: "The socks are ready for you to put on and be planned."
1. No. 2. None. 3. There are no grammatical mistakes in the sentence. It is a grammatically correct sentence in English.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because "play sonatas on" should be "play the sonatas on" or "play sonatas using this violin." The preposition "on" is incorrect in this context. The corrected sentence would be: "This violin is difficult to play the sonatas on." or "This violin is difficult to play sonatas using this violin."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is missing a verb after "please." Additionally, the conjunction "and" is not necessary in this context. The correct sentence would be: "My mother is easy to please my father." The corrected sentence would be: "My mother is easy to please my father."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the pronoun "it" is ambiguous and does not clearly refer to a noun in the previous clause. Additionally, the sentence is missing a verb after "rain." The correct sentence would be: "Poor Bill, it had started to rain and he had no umbrella." The corrected sentence would be: "Poor Bill, it had started to rain and he had no umbrella."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because "that the cops spoke to the janitor about it yesterday" and "that robbery" are two independent clauses that need to be connected with a conjunction or a relative pronoun.  Additionally, "that" before "robbery" is unnecessary. The correct sentence would be: "That the cops spoke to the janitor about it yesterday is terrible. The robbery was a terrible incident." The corrected sentence would be: "That the cops spoke to the janitor about it yesterday is terrible. The robbery was a terrible incident."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because "and he wears socks" is not a correct way to connect "every student" and "is a swinger." Additionally, "he wears socks" is not a complete sentence and does not make sense in this context. The correct sentence would be: "Every student is a swinger. He wears socks." The corrected sentence would be: "Every student is a swinger. He wears socks."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the use of the indefinite pronoun "that" without a clear antecedent. Additionally, the preposition "by him" is not necessary in this context. The correct sentence would be: "She was given my binoculars by him." The corrected sentence would be: "She was given my binoculars by him."
1. No. 2. None. 3. There are no grammatical mistakes in the sentence. It is a grammatically correct sentence in English.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct, but it would be more clear if it was revised to say "Nobody who hates eating anything should work in a delicatessen." This is because the phrase "to eat" is unnecessary and "eating" is a more natural way to express the idea. The corrected sentence would be: "Nobody who hates eating anything should work in a delicatessen."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct, but it would be more clear if it was revised to say "Everybody around here who ever buys anything on credit talks in their sleep." This is because "his" is a possessive pronoun, and it doesn't make sense in this context because "sleep" is not something that belongs to a specific person. "Their" is a plural possessive pronoun, and it is more appropriate in this sentence. The corrected sentence would be: "Everybody around here who ever buys anything on credit talks in their sleep."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct, but it would be more clear if it was revised to say "I can't remember the name of someone who had misgivings." This is because "somebody" is an indefinite pronoun, and it's not clear who is being referred to. "Someone" is a more specific and clear pronoun to use in this context. The corrected sentence would be: "I can't remember the name of someone who had misgivings."

1. No 2. None 3. The sentence is grammatically correct.
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The sentence is missing a comma after "her old car." It should be "Sarah promised Catherine her old car, but then gave it to her son instead."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct, but it could be improved in terms of clarity and specificity. The term "partway" is somewhat ambiguous and could be interpreted in different ways, depending on the context. It might be clearer to specify the exact point at which the book was lent, such as "I lent the book to Tony halfway through."
1. No. 2. None. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct and clear in its meaning.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because "dumped" is in the past tense, while "with apples" should be set off with a comma to show that it's a prepositional phrase. The correct sentence would be: "The farmer dumped the cart, with apples spilling out."

However, this would require more context to be clear.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the incorrect use of the preposition "to." The correct sentence would be: "Sharon came into the room." Alternatively, if "came" is intended to mean "entered," the sentence could be written as "Sharon entered the room."

1. No. 2. None. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct and clear in its meaning.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the word order. The correct sentence would be: "Brian threw the stick over the fence."

So the corrected sentence would be: "The books lifted up onto the table."
1. Yes, there is one grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistake in your sentence is that the verb "loaded" should be in the past participle form "loaded" to function as the past participle in the passive voice construction, and the object of the preposition "under" should be in the correct form.

A correct sentence would be "Carla slid the book."
1. Yes, there are grammar mistakes in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistakes is syntax and morphology. 3. There are two mistakes: The verb "slid" needs to be in its base form "slide" as it is the main verb in the sentence. The phrase "at the book" is not correct. It should be "on the book" or "towards the book" depending on the intended meaning. A correct sentence would be "Carla slid on the book."
1. No, there are no grammar mistakes in your sentence. 2. N/A 3. None.
1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3.

1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct, but the word "that" is not necessary and can be omitted. The correct sentence would be "This flyer differs from that flyer." Alternatively, if the speaker wants to specifically point out two flyers, they can say "This flyer and the other one differ."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The phrase "differ apart" is not idiomatic, and it doesn't make sense. The correct preposition to use in this context is "from." The sentence should be "This flyer differs from that flyer."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The subject of the sentence is "the jeweller" and the verb is "scribbled," which is in the past tense. However, the verb should be in its base form because the subject is a pronoun and not a noun. The correct sentence would be "He scribbled the contract with his name."

1. No, there are no grammar mistakes in your sentence. 2. N/A 3. None.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The subject of the sentence is "Susan" and the verb is "whispered," which is in the past tense. However, the verb should be in its base form because the subject is a pronoun and not a noun. The correct sentence would be "Susan whispered to Rachel." The other mistake is the use of "at Rachel" which is not clear what it refers to, it should be "to Rachel" or "at her" which is more clear and specific.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The subject of the sentence is "Ellen" and the verb is "said," which is in the past tense. However, the verb should be in its base form because the subject is a pronoun and not a noun. The correct sentence would be "Ellen said that the melons were selling well." The other mistake is the use of "that melons" which is not clear, it should be "that the melons" or "that they were selling well" which is more clear and specific. Also, the use of "were selling" instead of "sold" which is more correct in past tense, because it's talking about a general truth that melons are selling well in a specific time, not that they were selling well at a specific time.

1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The subject of the sentence is "Cynthia" and the verb is "chewed," which is in the past tense. However, the verb should be in its base form because the subject is a pronoun and not a noun. The correct sentence would be "Cynthia chewed the food."

1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The mistake is that the verb "jumped" should be in its past participle form "jumped" to function as the past participle of the verb "jump". The correct sentence would be "Out of the box, a little white rabbit had jumped."
1. There is no grammatical mistake in your sentence. 2. None. 3. There are no mistakes in the sentence.
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The category of the mistake is syntax because the sentence is missing an verb for the subject "Jackie".

A correct version of the sentence would be "Jackie accompanied Rose to the store."
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The category of the mistake is syntax. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is a sentence fragment. It lacks a complete subject and a verb in the independent clause.

1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The category of the mistake is syntax. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is not in the standard English word order for a sentence. The correct word order for a sentence with a subject "John" and a predicate "offers many advice" would be "John offers much advice."
1. There is no grammatical mistake in your sentence. 2. None. 3. There are no mistakes in the sentence.
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The category of the mistake is syntax. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is not in the standard word order for a sentence in English.

1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The category of the mistake is syntax. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is not in the standard word order for a sentence in English. The correct word order for a sentence with a singular subject "I" and a predicate "saw that gas can explode" would be "I saw that a gas can can explode."
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The category of the mistake is syntax. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is not in the standard word order for a sentence in English. The correct word order for a sentence with a singular subject "He" and a predicate "washed her" would be "He washed her." Note: The sentence could also be interpreted as having a plural subject "He and her" and a predicate "wash each other," which would be grammatically correct. However, this interpretation changes the meaning of the sentence.
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The category of the mistake is syntax. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is not a proper imperative sentence. In English, imperative sentences are used to give commands or make requests and usually begin with a verb. The correct way to form an imperative sentence in the second person singular (addressing one person) would be "Wash yourself!" or "Wash your hands!" Note: The sentence could also be interpreted as a typo for "Wash you!" with an exclamation mark, but even then, it is not a proper imperative sentence.
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The category of the mistake is syntax. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is not in the standard word order for a sentence in English. The correct word order for a sentence with a plural subject "They" and a predicate "have no in" would be "They have no 'in'." Note: The sentence could also be interpreted as having a plural subject "They" and a predicate "have no in," but this would be grammatically incorrect because "in" is not a noun or a pronoun that a person or group could lack.
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The category of the mistake is syntax. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is not in the standard word order for a sentence in English. The correct word order for a sentence with a singular subject "Some of my jobs" and a predicate "are in jeopardy" would be "Some of my jobs are in jeopardy." Note: The sentence could also be interpreted as having a plural subject "Some of my jobs" and a predicate "are under threat," which would be grammatically correct. However, the intended meaning of the sentence is not clear without more context.
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The category of the mistake is syntax. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is not in the standard word order for a sentence in English. The correct word order for a sentence with a singular subject "It" and a predicate "was the policeman who met several young students in the park last night" would be "It was the policeman who met several young students in the park last night."

Note: The sentence could also be interpreted as having a singular subject "The monkey" and a predicate "is proud of its leader," which would be grammatically correct. However, the intended meaning of the sentence is not clear without more context.
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The category of the mistake is syntax. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it is not a proper sentence. The correct way to form a sentence in English is to have a complete subject and a predicate. In this case, the sentence seems to be incomplete and lacks a verb or a predicate to complete the thought. A correct version of the sentence would be "John sounded very happy."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. There is a missing verb in the sentence. The sentence is incomplete and needs to be revised to convey a complete thought. Here's an example of a corrected sentence: "I don't know if I should agree or not."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct except for the fact that the phrase "on the table" is redundant because "table" implies that the book is on a flat surface. The correct sentence would be "John bought a book."
1. No. 2. None. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct and conveys a clear meaning.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence should be revised to "I forgot how good beer tastes."

Also, "fountain" should be the direct object of the verb "is" and not the subject of the sentence.
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The mistake in your sentence is the use of the word "it" which is a pronoun that refers to a previously mentioned noun or antecedent, but in this sentence, it doesn't have a clear antecedent. The correct sentence would be: "The country tries to leave." The use of "it" is incorrect, it should be "the country" instead of "it" to indicate that the country is the subject of the sentence. Also, the verb "tries" should be in the singular form "tries" as "country" is singular and not plural. It would be grammatically correct if you use "the country" instead of "it" and "tries" instead of "tries" as the subject of the sentence.

Also, "seems" should be removed from the sentence and "is" should be used instead.
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The mistake in your sentence is the use of the word "there" which is a pronoun that refers to a location or a thing that is not mentioned in the sentence, and in this sentence, it doesn't make sense. The correct sentence would be: "Believed to be sheep in the park." The use of "there" is incorrect, it should be removed from the sentence. Also, "there" is used to indicate a location and not a subject of the sentence.

Also, "in the park" is a prepositional phrase that functions as an adverb modifying the verb "are" and not the subject. Also, "there" should be removed from the sentence and "believed to be" should be used instead.
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The mistake in your sentence is the use of the word "would" which is a past tense form of the verb "will" and it's not appropriate in this sentence. The correct sentence would be: "I hope to study in France." The use of "would" is incorrect, it should be "will" instead of "would" to indicate that the speaker is making a future prediction. It would be grammatically correct if you use "will" instead of "would" to indicate that the speaker is making a future prediction. Also, "to would" is incorrect, it should be "to" instead of "to would" to indicate the infinitive form of the verb "study". Also, "to would" should be changed to "to" to indicate the infinitive form of the verb "study" Also, "study in France" is a prepositional phrase that functions as an adverb modifying the verb "study" and not the subject.

1. No. 2. None. 3. There are no mistakes in your sentence. It is grammatically correct.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses a relative clause with a plural subject "who achieved the best result" to refer to a singular noun "Angela." This creates an ambiguity as to whether "who" refers to "Angela" or to a group of people. To make the sentence grammatically correct, you could use a singular subject "she" instead of "who": "Angela achieved the best result." Alternatively, if you want to use a relative clause, you could make the subject of the clause singular to match the subject of the sentence: "She achieved the best result was Angela."
1. No. 2. None. 3. There are no mistakes in your sentence. It is grammatically correct.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses a plural subject "that kind of person" to refer to a singular noun "anyone." This creates an ambiguity as to whether the verb "look after" refers to "anyone" or to a group of people. To make the sentence grammatically correct, you could use a singular subject "someone" instead of "anyone": "That kind of person is hard to find someone to look after." Alternatively, if you want to use a plural subject, you could make the object of the verb "look after" plural to match the subject: "That kind of person is hard to find anyone who will look after them." In this case, "them" is used as a plural pronoun to refer to "that kind of person" who needs care.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses a present tense verb "doesn't hunt" to describe a situation in the present, but the main clause "A sick owl" describes a situation in the present perfect "has been sick." The verb "hunt" is also incorrect for the subject "owl," which is a bird of prey that catches its own food, not hunts it. To make the sentence grammatically correct, you could use a verb that is suitable for the subject and tense of the sentence: "A sick owl doesn't catch mice." This uses the present perfect tense "doesn't catch" to agree with the present perfect tense of the main clause, and the verb "catch" is more suitable for an owl's behavior. Alternatively, you could use the present perfect tense throughout the sentence: "A sick owl has not been hunting mice." This uses the present perfect tense for both the main clause and the verb "hunting," which is more appropriate for the subject "owl."

1. No. 2. None. 3. There are no mistakes in your sentence. It is grammatically correct.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses a negative "not" to negate the verb "got," but the verb "got" is already in the negative form "even." To make the sentence grammatically correct, you could remove the unnecessary negative "not" to leave just the negative verb form: "I'm sure we even got these tickets." This conveys the same meaning as the original sentence, but without the grammatical error. Alternatively, you could use a different negative form to negate the verb "got," such as "I'm sure we didn't get these tickets." This also conveys the same meaning as the original sentence, but with a different negative form.
1. No. 2. None. 3. There are no mistakes in your sentence. It is grammatically correct.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses a comma to separate the two independent clauses, but the clauses are closely related in meaning and should be joined by a conjunction such as "because." To make the sentence grammatically correct, you could use a conjunction to connect the two clauses: "It's not because I have any sympathy for urban guerillas that I helped him." This conveys a clear cause-effect relationship between the two clauses and makes the sentence grammatically correct. Alternatively, you could rephrase the sentence to use a different structure or wording that avoids the need for a comma: "It's not that I have any sympathy for urban guerillas that I helped him." This also conveys the intended meaning without the grammatical error.
1. No. 2. None. 3. There are no mistakes in your sentence. It is grammatically correct.
1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistake is that "whined" is not the correct verb form to use with the subject "John."

1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistake is that the preposition "after" is not the correct choice to use in this sentence. The correct preposition to use would be "at," which indicates the time when the action of giving the book occurred. Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "I gave Mary a book at the party." Additionally, it would be more natural to say "I gave Mary the book at the party" or "I gave Mary the book after the party," depending on the intended meaning.
1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistake is that the sentence contains a comma splice, which is the incorrect use of a comma to join two independent clauses. The sentence should be two separate sentences, or the clauses should be connected with a coordinating conjunction or a semicolon. Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "Because she's so pleasant, I really like Mary. As for her, I think she's great."
1. No, there is no grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. None. 3. There are no grammatical errors in your sentence.

1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistake is that the sentence is grammatically incomplete.

1. No, there is no grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. None. 3. There are no grammatical errors in your sentence.

1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistake is that the sentence is grammatically incomplete. It should include a main verb to express the action of wanting something. Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "I don't want any trouble." However, it would be more natural to use "I don't want any problems" or "I don't want any issues" to be more specific about what kind of trouble is being referred to. Therefore, the sentence could be revised to: "I don't want any problems/issues."
1. No, there is no grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. None. 3. There are no grammatical errors in your sentence. However, it would be more natural to use "as tall as bamboo" instead of "as high as bamboo" to compare the height of the plants being referred to. Therefore, the sentence could be revised to: "They may grow as tall as bamboo."
1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistake is that the sentence is grammatically incomplete. It should include a main verb to express the action of making errors. Additionally, the use of "as" in this sentence is incorrect, as it is typically used to compare two things. Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "Some of them made 20 errors." However, it would be more natural to use "made as many as 20 errors" to indicate that some of them made a similar number of errors. Therefore, the sentence could be revised to: "Some of them made as many as 20 errors."
1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. 2. The category of the mistake is syntax. 3. The mistake is that the subject of the sentence, "Sally," is third person singular, which means that it requires a different verb form to agree with it. In this case, the correct verb form to use would be "kissed herself," which indicates that Sally is the one performing the action of kissing. Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "Sally kissed herself."
1. Yes, there are two grammar mistakes in your sentence. 2. The categories of the mistakes are syntax and semantics. 3. The first mistake is a syntax error. The sentence should be: "Drew believes that I think Rosie loves magazine ads." The use of the verb "think" twice in the sentence is incorrect, and the addition of "that" is necessary to clarify the subject of the sentence. The second mistake is a semantics error. The use of the word "loves" in the sentence is incorrect. It should be "is interested in" or "finds appealing" instead, as it is unclear from the sentence what Rosie's feelings are towards magazine ads. Therefore, the corrected sentence would be: "Drew believes that I think Rosie is interested in magazine ads."
1. No, there are no grammar mistakes in your sentence. 2. None. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct. It is a simple sentence with a subject "Dave, Dan, Erin, Jaime, and Alina" and a predicate "left." The use of a comma to separate the names of the people is also correct.

1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically correct, but it would be more natural if you used a different word order. The typical word order for a question like this would be "Peter has talked with whom?" or "With whom has Peter talked?"

1. No. 2. None. 3. There are no grammar mistakes in your sentence. It is a grammatically correct sentence in English.
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because "any" is typically used to refer to "one or some" of a group, rather than "all" of a group. In this case, it doesn't make sense to say that "any" owl hunts mice, because not all owls hunt mice. To fix the sentence, you could change "any" to "some" or "many," depending on the intended meaning. For example: "Some owls hunt mice." or "Many owls hunt mice."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because the negative form "didn't" is used to negate the verb "eat," but it is not used correctly with the indefinite pronoun "any." To fix the sentence, you could change "any man" to "no man" or "a man," depending on the intended meaning. For example: "No man ate dinner." or "A man ate dinner." Alternatively, if you meant to convey that any man did not eat dinner, you could use a different construction. For example: "Not any man ate dinner." or "No one ate dinner."

1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the use of the word "was" instead of "were" to agree with the singular subject "She". The correct sentence would be: "She asked if Alison was coming to the party."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because of the use of the word "never" to describe the duration of time during which Sir Thomas had not been offended.

1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses a relative clause with a singular pronoun "that" after a plural noun "the Dome". The correct sentence would be: "The idea dismayed the Prime Minister that the Dome was dull." In this sentence, "that" is used as a relative pronoun to introduce a clause that modifies "idea". However, "the Dome" is a plural noun and requires a plural pronoun "which" to function correctly in the relative clause. Therefore, the correct sentence would be: "The idea dismayed the Prime Minister that the Dome was dull."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence is grammatically incorrect because it uses an adverb "right" to modify the verb "came" in a way that is not idiomatic in standard English. The correct sentence would be: "He came right in without so much as a knock." In this sentence, "right" is used to indicate that the person came in quickly or directly, but it is not the usual adverb used to modify the verb "came." A more common adverb to use in this context would be "immediately" or "straight." Additionally, the use of "so much as" before "a knock" is incorrect, as it implies that there was no knock at all. A more natural phrasing would be "without so much as knocking."

1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The sentence is not grammatically correct because it contains two independent clauses that should be separated by a conjunction or a semicolon. The correct sentence would be "Kim alienated cats, and he beat his dog." The conjunction "and" is used to connect the two clauses, indicating that both actions happened simultaneously. The verb "beat" should also be in its past tense form "beat" to agree with the past tense of the first clause "alienated."

1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The sentence is not grammatically correct because it contains two infinitives "to go" and "to buying" that should be separated by a space. The correct sentence would be "She goes and buys some whiskey." The verb "goes" is in its base form and the verb "buys" is in its third-person singular form "buys" to agree with the subject "she."
1. Yes 2. Syntax 3. The sentence is not grammatically correct because it contains a plural subject "Kim and Terry" that should agree with a singular verb "is." The correct sentence would be "Kim and Terry are happy." The verb "are" is in its third-person plural form "are" to agree with the plural subject "Kim and Terry."
1. No. 2. None. 3. There are no grammatical mistakes
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence contains a run-on sentence, which means that two independent clauses are joined without the proper punctuation or conjunction. The clause "This girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill in the mailbox" is an independent clause, and the clause "on your desk before tomorrow" is also an independent clause. To correct this, you can use a comma and the conjunction "and" to separate the two clauses or use a semicolon to separate them as two independent clauses. Here are two possible corrections: "This girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill in the mailbox, and on your desk before tomorrow." "This girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill in the mailbox; on your desk before tomorrow."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence contains a repeated phrase, which means that the same phrase appears twice in the sentence. To correct this, you can either remove one of the instances of the phrase or use a synonym or a different phrase to avoid repetition. Here are two possible corrections: "Put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow. This girl in the red coat will do the same." "This girl in the red coat will place a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow. You should do the same."
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence contains a comma splice, which means that two independent clauses are improperly joined with a comma. The clause "Picture of Bill" is an independent clause, and the clause "this girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow" is also an independent clause. To correct this, you can use a comma and the conjunction "and" to separate the two clauses or use a semicolon to separate them as two independent clauses. Here are two possible corrections: "Picture of Bill, and this girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow." "Picture of Bill; this girl in the red coat will put a picture of Bill on your desk before tomorrow."
1. No. 2. None. 3. There are no grammatical mistakes
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence contains a redundant word, which means that a word or phrase is repeated or unnecessary. In this case, the word "deadly" is redundant because "afraid" already indicates fear. To correct this, you can simply remove the word "deadly" from the sentence. Here is the corrected sentence: "John became afraid of flying."
1. No. 2. None. 3. There are no grammatical mistakes
1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence contains a run-on sentence, which means that two independent clauses are joined without the proper punctuation or conjunction. The clause "Henri wants to buy which books about cooking" is an independent clause, and the phrase "about cooking" is not a complete clause. To correct this, you can use a comma and the conjunction "about" to separate the two clauses or use a semicolon to separate them as two independent clauses. Here are two possible corrections: "Henri wants to buy which books about cooking?" "Henri wants to buy which books; about cooking is what he is interested in."

1. Yes. 2. Syntax. 3. The sentence contains a redundancy, which means that a word or phrase is repeated or unnecessary. In this case, the phrase "It was from six to nine or it took place from six to nine" contains two conflicting ideas. The first idea is that "it was" (past tense), indicating that the event has already happened, but the second idea is that "it took place" (present tense), indicating that the event is still happening or could happen in the future. To correct this, you can use one of the two phrases, depending on what you want to convey, and remove the other phrase. Here are two possible corrections: "It was from six to nine, or it took place from six to nine." (This sentence is grammatically correct, but it is redundant because both phrases convey the same time frame. To avoid redundancy, you can use only one phrase, depending on what you want to convey.) "It took place from six to nine." (This sentence is grammatically correct, and it conveys that the event took place between 6 PM and 9 PM. If you want to indicate that the event has already happened, you can use the past tense, such as "It took place from six to nine last night.")
