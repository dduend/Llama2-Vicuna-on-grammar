    4. Here's why: In English, we typically put adverbs after the verb, not before it. So instead of "beautifully plays," it should be "plays beautifully." Additionally, the word order in your original sentence is a bit awkward, so I suggest rephrasing it to make it more natural-sounding.

    3. The correct version of the sentence should be: Sue gave Bill a book.
    4. (Optional) Here's why: In English, when we use a direct object, it usually comes after the verb. So instead of "to Bill", we can put "Bill" directly after "gave". Additionally, in this case, "a book" is a singular noun and needs to be matched with a singular verb, so "gave" is more appropriate than "give".

    ASSISTANT:
    1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence. The word "but" should be followed by an infinitive phrase starting with "to", not just a noun phrase like "Mary". So, the corrected sentence would be: You may pick every flower, but leave some for Mary to grow.
    2. The category of the mistake is syntax.

    USER: I wrote a sentence in English, but I'm not sure if it's grammatically correct. Here's my sentence: Anson became a muscle bound. 1. Are there any grammar mistakes in my sentence? Yes or No; 2. If yes, what is the category of the mistake: syntax, morphology or semantics ? If there's no mistakes, write 'None'; 3. What is the correct version of the sentence?
    ASSISTANT:
    1. Yes, there is a grammar mistake in your sentence.
    2. The category of the mistake is syntax.
    3. The correct version of the sentence should be "Anson became muscle-bound." (Note: I changed "muscle bound" to "muscle-bound" with a hyphen to make it one word, which is the correct usage.)
